recipeingredient:
- " meat sauce"
- " butter"
- " onion sliced"
- " minced beef"

- " butter"
- " heaped of plain flour"
- " milk"
- " mustard powder"
- " grated cheese"
- " Seasoning"
- " mashed potato  I use a floury potato with lots of butter and a dash of milk"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add the minced beef to a preheated saucepan and fry quickly releasing the fat (if you use lean beef you&#39;ll have to use oil) add thinly sliced onion and lower the heat allowing onions to saute - you can use more meat if you want, but I buy 450g and steal 100g of it to make my Cornish pasties ;)"
- "When onions have become clear add the butter and melt"
- "Sprinkle the flour over the top of the neat and onion mixture and stir in to absorb the butter. Cook for 1 minute whilst stirring."
- "Add the beef stock a little at a time stirring well in between to avoid any lumps."
- "Put the meat layer into your chosen baking dish - I use a rectangular 12x8, 2 inch deep glass dish but you could choose round, smaller, deeper"
- "Now make the leek layer (leaving meat to cool helps keep the layers separate during cooking)"
- "Put butter into a saute pan with a lid. Add the sliced leeks and sweat with the lid on over a low heat"
- "When the leeks are soft, sprinkle over the flour and stir in for 1 minute"
- "Add the milk and stir in well now add the mustard powder and grated cheese"
- "If you don&#39;t have mustard powder you can use yellow English mustard. Add any seasoning at this point that you feel necessary - we all have different palates"
- "When leeks cooled dollop onto the meat sauce, then carefully, a forkfull at a time, cover it in mashed potato. I start from the centre so if I don&#39;t have enough mashed potato i just leave a border around the outside - it&#39;s ok, it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect"
- "So mashed potato - i may make fresh for this meal, but often I use leftover, so up to you but I would say that you need it to be fairly stiff."
- "You can keep in the fridge up to 48 hours before baking, the longer the better as it firms up the layers"
- "Bake at 180ºC gas 4 for 35 - 40 minutes until the meat starts bubbling through and it starts to form a sticky crust"

Add the minced beef to a preheated saucepan and fry quickly releasing the fat (if you use lean beef you&#39;ll have to use oil) add thinly sliced onion and lower the heat allowing onions to saute - you can use more meat if you want, but I buy 450g and steal 100g of it to make my Cornish pasties ;)

1. When leeks cooled dollop onto the meat sauce, then carefully, a forkfull at a time, cover it in mashed potato. I start from the centre so if I don&#39;t have enough mashed potato i just leave a border around the outside - it&#39;s ok, it doesn&#39;t have to be perfect
1. So mashed potato - i may make fresh for this meal, but often I use leftover, so up to you but I would say that you need it to be fairly stiff.
