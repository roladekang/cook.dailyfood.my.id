- "In a bundt pan, grease well and dust with bread crumbs. This is important to keep from sticking. Form rice mixture with wet hands around the bottom, up the sides. Only use 3/4 of rice. This leaves plenty of room for filling. Scoop in filling all the way around. With the remaining rice, form the top and seal the whole thing."
- "Bake at 350°F for 50 minutes or when rice starts to brown. Let this cool completely before you flip it. This is important. Then hold your breath as you flip it on a nice serving plate."
