recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the 2 cups sugar, corn syrup, and water in a small pot. Turn on heat to medium high/8 and stir until sugar dissolves. Once the mixture boils, DO NOT STIR. Cook all of the water out. It should stop steaming as much and when dropped into cold water, it should form hard brittle threads."
- "Put your color in now and let the boiling action stir it in, don&#39;t stir. Take it off the heat and set it to the side while you spray 2 silicone brownie bowls with cooking spray. Then pour into your bowl molds and leave to cool and harden about an hour."
- "When the bowls are hard, pop them out of the molds and allow to cool fully. Do not refrigerate. While they are cooling, take the metal bowl from the freezer and pour in your cream vanilla and sugar. Beat in an electric stand mixer or with a hand mixer until peaks form and the whipped cream is fluffy."
- "Put the whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a star tip and pipe into the cooled bowls. Top with sprinkles. The whipped cream will take on the candy flavor."
