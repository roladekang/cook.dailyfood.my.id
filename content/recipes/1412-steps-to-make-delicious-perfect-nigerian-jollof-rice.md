recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the rice in cold water until the water runs clear. Do this at least twice to remove the starch because you don&#39;t want starchy clumpy Jollof rice"
- "Place washed rice in a strainer and allow excess water to drain for another 2 minutes. This is because you don&#39;t want soggy Jollof rice you need it to absorb the natural flavour profile of your Jollof base sauce."
- "Next, put drained rice into pot. Add 1Â½ cups of water, add 1 maggi cube 1 teaspoon of vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon of maggi sauce. Mix well, cover and boil for 8 minutes on a medium heat. You are now infusing the rice with taste by doing this process"
- "Pour rice into strainer and run cold water gently for about 2 minutes to wash out extra starch and to stop cooking process. After this place rice in strainer for 2 minutes to drain excess water as you do not want soggy Jollof rice."
- "Add Â½ cup cooking oil to pot and allow to heat for 30 seconds, then gently pour in your jar of Obe-Ata from Toyin&#39;s Kitchen. Add 2 tablespoons of tomato puree 1 bay leaf, 1 teaspoon maggi sauce and mix well using a whisk. Whisk at each step for a total of 2 minutes on a low heat."
- "Pour in the drained rice gently and add 4 maggi cubes. Use a wooden spoon to mix thoroughly. TIP! The secret to a good looking Nigerian Jollof rice is that every grain of rice should be coated in the Jollof base you are creating."
- "Fill jar with 300ml water, shake well and rinse into Jollof rice mixture. Obe-Ata from Toyin&#39;s Kitchen is completely natural and does not have thickening agents or emulsifiers so always shake well before using and rinse jar into dish you are cooking."
- "Cover pot with foil then place lid and allow to steam on medium heat. After 10 minutes turn the rice again making sure every grain is coated in your amazing Jollof rice sauce you have made and allow the rice to soak in the natural flavours for an additional 30 minutes"
- "Traditional Nigerian Jollof Rice is ready! Obe-Ata from Toyin&#39;s Kitchen takes out the hard work so all you need to do is follow the steps and make the Perfect Jollof rice and share with your family and friends. Goes well with fried plantain and salad with a protein of your choice on the side."
