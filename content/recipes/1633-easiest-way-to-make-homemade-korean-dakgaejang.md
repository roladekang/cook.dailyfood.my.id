Cut the celery into 1-inch pieces.  Add the chicken breast, onion, leeks, celery, carrots, and garlic to a pot with 5 cups of water. Bring to boil over high heat then reduce the heat to medium. Cover and continue to boil for 10 minutes. While waiting for the broth… Step#2"

Add the vegetables (leeks, mushroom, white onion, and garlic) followed by the shredded chicken. Add the gochujang and dilute it in the broth. Then add the soy sauce, fish sauce, and corn syrup. Bring to a boil and cook for 10 minutes."
