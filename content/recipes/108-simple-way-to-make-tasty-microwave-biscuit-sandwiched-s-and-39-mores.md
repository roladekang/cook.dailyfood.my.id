recipeinstructions:
- "Align the biscuits on the turn table of your microwave. Place one marshmallow on each of them."
- "Microwave on HIGH for 15 seconds for each round. I have used a 1250 watts Microwave. The time might differ a little in others but that is nearly negligible. So there is nothing much to worry. They get done in a jiffy."
