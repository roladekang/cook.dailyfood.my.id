Check the seasoning and add extra salt and pepper to taste."
- "While the sauce continues simmering, cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions. When the noodles are almost cooked, add the basil and parsley to the sauce. Toss the noodles with the sauce and top with plenty of freshly grated parmesan cheese when serving."
