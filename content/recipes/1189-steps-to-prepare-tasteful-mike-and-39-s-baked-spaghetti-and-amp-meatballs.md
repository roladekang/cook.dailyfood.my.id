recipeinstructions:
- "Add everything in the Spaghetti Sauce Section and simmer for about an hour +. Seasonings not pictured alongside canned goods below."
- "Authors Note: Your sauce very well may have a metallic or a heavy acidic taste to it due to the high volume of tomatoes within it. If so, bring your pot to a simmer and add 1/4 teaspoon Baking Soda. Mix in and allow sauce to settle. It will foam up and even slightly discolor your sauce but it will return to normal within seconds so no worries! Taste test and add 1/4 teaspoon more if needed. Add 3-4 times @1/4 tsp at the most."
- "Mix everything in your meatball section and your reserved 1/2 cup of spaghetti sauce very well and roll into any size meatball you desire. I roll mine into oversized quarter sizes and bake for about 20 minutes at 350°."
- "Heat oven to 350° and bake your meatballs in your disposable pan for 20-35 minutes [depending upon sizes] or until fully cooked. Don&#39;t let them dry them out by baking them too long. It&#39;s better you undercooked them. Remember, they have to bake in the oven again in that same pan."
- "In a seperate pot, boil your noodles as per manufactures directions. [usually 8 to 12 minutes] Add 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon cooking oil to your boiling water before placing noodles in the pot and beginning your boil time."
- "Drain noodles [do not rinse!] in sink and place your noodles in your spaghetti sauce pot. Drain meatballs as well [on paper towels] and place in that same spaghetti pot. Mix everything well but not so well you break up your meatballs."
- "Re-spray your disposable pan again [if needed-and on the sides] with cooking oil and pile in your spaghetti and meatballs. Top with garlic powder, Parmesan and Motzerella Cheese and fresh Basil and Parsley."
- "Bake at 350° for up to 30 minutes. Check dish while baking to see if your cheeses are melting and your spaghetti isn&#39;t drying out too much."
- "Serve with Tabasco Sauce and warm Garlic bread on the side. Below is a 3 minute prep time-30 minute bake time recipe for one. Enjoy!  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/351128-mikes-5-min-garlic-parmesan-bread"
