- "Now add water little at a time and mix till you get a dosa batter consistency. Let the batter rest for about 15 to 20 minutes."
- "As the batter is resting, we will go ahead with the making of the coconut chutney. For it, we have to first roast the chana dal. In a blender, add coconut."
- "Next, add roasted chana dal, ginger, tamarind paste, green chillies and water and grind to a smooth paste."
- "Remove it into a serving bowl. Now for tempering the coconut chutney, take a tadka pan. Add oil. When the oil turns hot, add mustard seeds and allow it to crackle. Add urad dal and fry until light golden in color. Off the flame and add chilli flakes. You can add whole dry red chillies. Pour this tadka over the ground chutney and mix it well."

- "To stop the masalas from burning, add little water. When the water starts boiling, add the mashed potatoes and keep sauting. The moment the potatoes have absorbed the water, add the salt. Salt should be added at the end."
- "In the end, you can add more salt and dry mango powder, if required. Garnish with chopped coriander leaves. Give it a nice mix."
- "Now before making the dosa, add baking soda and little water and mix well."
- "Now to make the dosa, heat a pan on medium flame. Sprinkle little water to check if the pan is hot. If the water bubbles means the pan is ready to make the dosa. Wipe the pan with a clean cloth. Add the batter in the center and slowly spread it out towards the sides. Spray oil and roast it lightly. The moment the surfaces dries and brown color appears means the dosa is ready."
- "Before making the next dosa, again sprinkle water and wipe with a cloth. This helps to reduce the temperature of the pan before pouring the batter for the next dosa. Now the pan is ready to make the next dosa. If you do it slowly and carefully, the result is amazing."
- "Instant Rava Dosa is ready. To enjoy its crispiness, serve it immediately with Coconut Chutney and Karnataka Style Aloo Masala."
