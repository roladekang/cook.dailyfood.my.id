- "70 grams Cake flour"
- "30 grams Sugar"
- "210 grams Egg liquid milk  1 egg yolk"
- "4 1/2 grams Salt"
- "18 grams Unsalted butter"
- "4 grams Dry yeast"
- "8 grams Matcha"
- "8 grams Cocoa powder"
recipeinstructions:
- "Put all the ＊ ingredients in a bread machine! (Mix the milk and egg yolk together, and microwave until it&#39;s warmed up to body temperature; 40-60 seconds / 35-38°C.) Put the dry yeast in the yeast compartment."
- "When the dough is done kneading (before the 1st rising starts), take it out of the machine. (Using my bread machine, it takes about 20 minutes.)"
- "Divide the dough into 3 portions for each part of the panda. About 75 g or 1/6 for the cocoa dough; about 210 g or 1/3 for the plain dough; about 285 g or 1/2 for the matcha dough. These weights are what I had (FYI)."
- "Knead the dissolved cocoa powder into the chocolate dough portion, and the dissolved matcha into the matcha dough portion."
- "Round off each poriton of dough, place seam side down, and cover with plastic wrap and a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel. Leave the dough to proof (1st rising. If using a microwave for this, it takes about 30 to 40 minutes)."
- "Deflate the dough lightly, cover again and leave to rest for about 20 to 30 minutes. Deflate again."
- "It&#39;s time to put the loaf together! Roll a bit less than half the plain dough (90 g) and 1/6 each of the cocoa dough (27 g each) into cylindrical shapes by rolling them on your work surface. Stick the cocoa dough pieces on the plain dough piece (the cocoa pieces are the eyes)."
- "Fill the space between the cocoa pieces with about 1/4 of the plain dough."
- "Roll out the remaining plain dough with a rolling pin, and wrap it around the formed dough parts as if you were wrapping a sushi roll. *Put the seam on the bottom and seal."
- "Cut the remaining cocoa dough in half, roll each piece out into a long thin pieces, and attach to the top (for the ears)."
- "Fill the gap between the ears with a bit more than 1/4 of the matcha dough."
- "Roll out the rest of the matcha dough with a rolling pin, and wrap it around the formed dough as if you were wrapping a sushi roll. *Lay seam side down and seal the edges."
- "Put the dough in an oiled square loaf pan (in the middle of the pan) and cover with plastic wrap and a tightly wrung out moistened kitchen towel. Leave for the 2nd rising, until the dough has risen to 1 cm under the rim of the pan. If proofing it in a microwave, it takes about 50 to 60 minutes."
- "Put the lid on the loaf pan, and bake in a 200 °C oven for 25 to 30 minutes."
- "This is a failed attempt. I added more of the eye-colored dough, and they got too droopy."
