- "Fry your Extra Lean Hamburger and drain if necessary. Place in soup pot. This meat ingredient is optional but hamburger is solid protein [almost zero carbohydrates] and it really won&#39;t increase your calories by much. You&#39;ll also need the energy this important protein provides you."
- "Simmer for an hour + or until veggies are somewhat softened. Add additional broth as the soup boils down."
- "IMPORTANT INFORMATION:                                                                                                                   °This massive pot of soup measures approximately 1,500 calories TOTAL and can last an individual dieter up to 7 - 8 days. Remember, most doctors &amp; nutritionists recommend a 1,500 calorie per DAY diet minimum for dieters. Anything less is considered a starvation diet. Once that occurs, your metabolism will panic, hold on tightly to its fat reserve and refuse to lose any additional weight for several weeks. By that time, we&#39;ve just given up.
