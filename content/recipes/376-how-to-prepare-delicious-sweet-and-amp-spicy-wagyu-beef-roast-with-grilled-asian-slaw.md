recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE ASIAN SLAW In a bowl, combine the rice wine vinegar, sugar, toasted sesame oil, soy sauce, grated ginger, and chili garlic sauce. This is your dressing.

Grill the cabbage halves and quarters on medium heat until the leaves are slightly charred. Remove the cabbage from the grill, and thinly slice."
- "Add the grilled cabbage, shredded carrots, sliced green onions, and chopped cilantro to the bowl with the dressing. Cover the bowl, and refrigerate for 2 hours to soften the cabbage."
- "PREPARING THE MARINADE Combine the marinade ingredients (hoisin sauce, chili garlic sauce, rice wine vinegar, salt, and freshly ground black pep-per) in a large bowl. Slice the Fullblood Wagyu chuck underblade roast into 2 similar-sized pieces. Place the beef in the bowl with the marinade, and coat with the marinade.

- "FINAL STEPS Remove the Asian slaw from the fridge, and add the strips of Asian pear to the slaw. Combine all ingredients."
