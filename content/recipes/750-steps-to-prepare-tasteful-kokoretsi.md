recipeingredient:
- " lamb offals without the kidneys"
- " extra sweetbreads"
- " lamb caul fats"
- " lamb intestines"
- " the juice of 2 lemons"
- " oregano"
- " salt"
- " pepper"
- " little finely chopped garlic optionally"
recipeinstructions:
- "Wash the intestines thoroughly. It is easier to wash them if you fit one end of the intestines on the tap, fill it with water and draw it down through the rest of the intestine with your fingers. Place them in a bowl with the lemon juice to whiten and firm them making sure that you pull the ends apart."
- "Cut the offal to pieces that are the size of walnuts and let them strain. Season with pepper, sprinkle with oregano and the garlic and start adding them on a spit, alternately. Season with salt last, when you pass the pieces on the spit so that they are not slippery. One piece of liver, one lung, spleen, sweetbreads and then start over. When you are done, squeeze them tight so that there is no space between them and wrap them with the caul fats. Then wrap them as tight as possible with the intestines."
- "Set the kokoretsi aside on the spit, covered, to dry and get the flavor from the seasoning. If you roast it over embers place the spit close to the embers at first and turn relatively fast until it gets golden brown. Then place it higher and turn leaving it for a while at its four settings. It has to be well cooked but not dripping."
- "If you don&#39;t roast it over embers you can remove the spit very carefully and place the kokoretsi on a baking tray so that you cook it in the oven. Don&#39;t add any water because it lets out a lot of liquids. Brush with oil on both ways of cooking."
