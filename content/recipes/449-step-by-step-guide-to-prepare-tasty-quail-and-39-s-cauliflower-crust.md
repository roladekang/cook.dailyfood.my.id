recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 425°. Line baking tray with parchment paper or silicone mat. Set aside."
- "Steam cauliflower and drain well. Pulse in food processor until it&#39;s rice-like in texture. Squeeze out as much moisture as possible using a cheesecloth."
- "Transfer cauliflower to a large bowl. Stir in egg, mozzarella, goat cheese, and spices. I like using garlic, oregano, basil, thyme, rosemary..things of that sort."
- "Carefully spread mixture on lined baking tray until it&#39;s about 1/4 in thick. You can try to make it even thinner, just as long there are no holes in your crust. A rubber spatula works really well for this. Crust usually spreads out to 10 inches or even a little more."
- "Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until crust is dry and golden. Then FLIP IT! This is key. This is why the parchment paper is so handy. I like using a second baking tray lined with paper so I can just stack it on top and flip it without any accidents."
- "Once flipped, bake again for an additional 5 minutes or so, until this side is also dry and golden. You want to do this before adding any sauce or toppings so that your cauliflower doesn&#39;t get rehydrated and soggy."
- "Add sauce, whatever toppings, and bake for 5 more minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly. Take out and let it chill for a few minutes before cutting. &lt;3"
