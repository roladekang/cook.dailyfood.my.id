- "Now add the chopped green chillies (1 to 2 green chilies, chopped finely), ¼ to ½ teaspoon punjabi garam masala powder or garam masala powder, ¼ to ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder or deghi mirch (optional), ½ to 1 teaspoon amchur (dry mango powder) and salt as per taste."

- "With a spoon or hand, mix the spice powders and green chilies with the mashed potatoes very well. Check the taste and add more salt or red chilli powder or dry mango powder if required."
- "In another bowl or pan, take 2 cups whole wheat flour. Make a well in the center. Add ½ teaspoon salt or as required, 1 tablespoon kasuri methi and ¼ tablespoon ajwain."

- "Keep the flame to medium-high or high for a thick bottomed and heavy tawa. For a medium or thin bottomed and less heavy tawa, keep the flame to medium-low to medium."
- "When the base is partly cooked, flip the paratha. Spread some ghee on the partly cooked part. You can also use oil instead of ghee. If using oil, then use peanut oil or sunflower oil."
- "Flip again and you will see nice golden blisters on the second side. This time the side which has been spread with ghee will be at the bottom. This side has to be cooked more than the previous side"
- "Spread some ghee on the second side facing you. A well made and well-roasted alu paratha will puff up.Flip again once or twice till both the sides are cooked properly. You should see crisp brown spots on the alu paratha. You can also press the paratha edges with a spatula or spoon, so that they are fried well. Since sometimes, the paratha edges are not cooked well. Make all parathas this way."
- "You can also serve the aloo paratha directly from the tawa (skillet) straight in the serving plate. Serve some extra butter on the side, along with mango pickle or lemon pickle or dal makhani or some fresh curd (yogurt)"
