Let rice absorb most of the liquid before adding more. When you add the last cup of broth, add butter and pecorino. Stir until risotto has a smooth consistency and the rice is tender."
- "Whether you deep fried or baked the chicken, when it reaches 160 degrees internal, add the sliced cheese on top. Place in the oven on broil until the cheese becomes bubbly and just starts to brown."
- "Plate the risotto. Add the chicken roulade on top. Drape a few sprigs of asparagus over and garnish with a lemon wedge. The lemon is meant to be squeezed over the entire dish. Serve immediately. Enjoy."
