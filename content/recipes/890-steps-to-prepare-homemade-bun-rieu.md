- "Gently fold the crab meat with the shrimp mixture and ground pork until uniform."
- "Boil the broth from above. When it is boiling take the meatball mixture and make free formed meatballs with a spoon putting them into the broth. Add the fried tofu at this point. The meatballs are cooked when they start floating to the top."
- "For toppings, chop up the remaining green onions from the bunch and cilantro bunch – slice the remaining white onion thinly – quarter the limes."
- "To assemble, put noodles in a bowl, add any of the toppings/garnishes. Ladle in the soup with tomatoes and meatballs. Squeeze some lime and add some chilli sate."
