- "Prepare the chili caviar.  Transfer oil into a tall cylindrical bottle and chill in the fridge overnight or in a freezer for at least 2 hrs.  In a sauce pot, add chili paste, water and agar agar.  Stir to combine well.  Turn the heat up to medium-high."
- "Bring it up to a boil.  Allow it to boil for 2 mins.  Remove from heat and immediately, use a syringe to suck up the coffee mixture or transfer it into a squeeze bottle.  Slowly drip the chili mixture into the bottle of cold oil.  Repeat this step for the remaining chili."
- "If the chili starts to cool down, heat up the chili over the stove and repeat the process. Make sure the chili paste that you are using is a smooth paste.*  Drain thru&#39; a sieve over a large bowl.  *You can reuse the oil.*"
- "Plunge the chili caviar into a bowl of clean water to wash excess oil.  Remove and plunge into another bowl of clean water.  Repeat the steps until the water is clean of oil.

Dredge the basil leaves with oil and lay on the same baking tray.  *You can place another piece of parchment paper over the kiwi and basil, place some weight on top to prevent the leaves and kiwi from curling during baking process.*"

- "Place a bowl over another bowl of ice.  *This step will prevent the puree from separating.*  Transfer the carrot puree into the bowl thru&#39; a fine sieve.  Transfer into a squeeze bottle and keep chill until ready to use."
- "Prepare the scallops.  Season the scallops well with salt and ras el hanout.  In a skillet over medium-high heat, add oil.  Heat the oil to the smoking point.  In a bowl, mix in ghee and nori flakes.  Place in the scallops."
- "There is a large and small side of a scallop. Always sear the larger side 1st. Sear the scallops in batches. Do not crowd the skillet.*  Tilt the skillet and baste the scallops with the hot oil.  Keep basting until the bottom is browned."
- "Flip and add in the ghee mixture.  Tilt the skillet and continue basting with all the liquid.  Remove from heat and set aside on a plate lined with parchment paper to drain off any excess oil."
- "Repeat the process for the remaining scallops.  In the same skillet, add about 1/2 inch of oil.  Deglaze and bring the oil to the smoking point.  Gently lay a rice paper."
