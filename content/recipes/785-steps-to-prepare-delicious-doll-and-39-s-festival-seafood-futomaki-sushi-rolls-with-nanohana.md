- "Wet your hands with water, and place 1/3 of the sushi rice on top of a sheet of nori seaweed. Make sure not to spread out both of the ends too thinly. It will thin out when you wrap it."
- "Lay the delicate broccolini, shrimp, and imitation crab in the center. Lay the tuna and tamagoyaki on top."
- "Use the front end of the rice to wrap up the ingredients, and roll up after squeezing tightly."
- "You will get a cleaner cut if the rice and ingredients are tightly packed together, so let it sit for a while wrapped in the sushi mat."
- "When cutting, cut the rolls by moving the knife back and forth in a sawing motion, and wipe the blade with a wet cloth between each cut."
