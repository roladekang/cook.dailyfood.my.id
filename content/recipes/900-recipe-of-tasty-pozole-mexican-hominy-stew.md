recipeinstructions:
- "If using fresh Hominy (Pozole), soak overnight as you would dried beans if you want. If using canned Hominy, skip to step 3. I have to say either Pozole works, but fresh gives that &#34;authentic&#34; flair."
- "Drain the hominy and put in a large &#34;caldero&#34; or soup pot. Cover with water and bring to a boil. Let simmer briskly for 1 hour."
- "During Hominy cooking, toast Chiles in skillet or grill top taking care not to burn and develop a really off flavor. After, slit lengthwise and remove stems and seeds."
- "Place Chiles in pot with 4 cups of water, simmer 30 minutes and allow to cool. Blend to a paste using some of the water you simmered with making a consistency of roughly pancake batter."
- "Season Pork Belly and Shoulder with Salt and Pepper. I prefer to sear (Brown) the Shoulder, but the choice is yours. Either way, after Pozole has been cooking 1 hour, add the Pork Belly and Shoulder to the pot. Add the Onion with Cloves, Toasted Cumin Seeds, Bay Leaf and Garlic."
- "Cover with enough water 2 inches, then bring back to a brisk simmer. Top with water occasionally and taste broth for salt, simmer for about 2 1/2 hours more, meat should be tender and pozole grains should have softened and burst. Skim fat from surface if desired."
- "Add 1 cup chile purée and simmer for 10 minutes. Taste and correct seasoning. Add more purée if desired."
- "When serving, put pozole, meat and broth into big bowls. Garnish with pieces of thinly sliced cabbage, diced onion, lime wedges, cilantro and oregano as desired."
- "In my pic, I had White Rice left over so I just served over that. I KNOW....2 starches.....sue me!"
