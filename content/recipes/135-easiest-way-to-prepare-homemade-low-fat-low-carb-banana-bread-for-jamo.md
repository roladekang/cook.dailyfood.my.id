- "1/2 cup brown sugar or more if you prefer sweeter"
- "2 cups wholemeal flour"
- "2 eggs"
- "1/4 cup millk"
- "1 tbsp baking soda"
- "1 tsp vanilla"

recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 180 degrees, fan assisted. Pre line cake tine with baking parchment or oil (rectangular works best-I use 20.5x11cm). Using baking parchment helps lift cake out of tin if it&#39;s no a spring cake form."

- "Bake at 180 on a high shelf in the oven for 45-60min. Check that it&#39;s cooked through using a knife (no cake residue should be on knife when it&#39;s pulled out of cake)."
