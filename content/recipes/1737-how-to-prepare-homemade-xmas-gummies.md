recipeinstructions:
- "Measure out the water, make sure it&#39;s really cold (put it in the fridge if needed)"
- "In a different container, start soaking the gelatin sheets so they go soft"
- "Pour in the syrup and mix until the mixture is completely transparent and smooth."
- "Pour in the jell-o and mix again."
- "Crush up the vitamin c tablets into a powder and mix them in, this gives the gummies a nice sour taste!"
- "Now take out the gelatin, squeeze out any excess water, and mix it all in a pot on medium heat."
- "After about 5-10 mins the gelatin should have dissolved, and you&#39;ll have a smooth, fruity syrup."
- "Put the syrup in the fridge for a bit, and you&#39;ll see that the foam and the clear syrup will start to separate, with the foam on top"
- "After a few more mins the foam will harden allowing you to remove it with a fork. If it&#39;s still liquid leave it in the fridge some more. If you leave it too long the whole thing will harden, but don&#39;t worry, you can melt it again in the pot :)"
- "With the foam gone, you should have a nice, uniformly transparent syrup left, which you can pour into a silicone mold."
- "Put in the fridge for a while and your gummies are ready!"
