Coat well &amp; set aside in the fridge until ready to use.  *The above steps are to remove the seafood odor &amp; also making the shrimps extra bouncy.*"
- "In a food processor, add onion, garlic, @chillibellasg’s Sambal &amp; tomato puree.  Blitz until fine paste forms.  In a skillet or pan over medium heat, add oil.  Once the oil is heated up, add in the spice mixture.  Season with salt &amp; drizzle in the gula melaka  Sauté until well combined &amp; color is darkened."
- "Add in shrimps.  Add 1/4 cup of hot water into the same bowl (used for marinading the shrimps) to clean up any nooks &amp; crannies.  Pour the hot water mixture into the skillet or pan.  Deglaze &amp; stir to combine well.  Bring it up to a slow simmer."
- "Create a crater &amp; slide in an egg (this is optional, only 1 TBSP of egg white is used for marinading the shrimps, why not cook the whole egg too).  Cover &amp; cook until the egg white &amp; yolk cook to your preference.  Remove from heat &amp; garnish with scallions, coriander, or parsley.  You can serve this over steamed rice or deep fried Vietnamese rice paper."
- "To deep fry the Vietnamese rice paper, add about 1 inch of oil in a skillet.  Once the oil is heated up, carefully drop the paper into the oil.  It will crisp up immediately.  Remove from heat &amp; set aside to drain off excess oil.*  Serve immediately."
- "If you are not residing in Singapore, you can replace the sambal with any chili or hot sauce of your preference. Harissa, Sambal Oelek, or Thai Red Chili Sauce will be awesome as well."
