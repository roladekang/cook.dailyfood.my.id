This is my mom&#39;s special homemade lasagna recipe with made from scratch tomato sauce and delicious, cheesy filling. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty. From Italian lasagna (and its plural lasagne), possibly from Vulgar Latin *lasania, from Latin lasanum (&#34;cooking pot&#34;), from Ancient Greek λάσανον (lásanon, &#34;trivet or stand for a pot&#34;). Others argue the Italian lasagna originally derived from the Arabic لَوْزِينَج‎ (lawzīnaj, &#34;almond cake&#34;).
