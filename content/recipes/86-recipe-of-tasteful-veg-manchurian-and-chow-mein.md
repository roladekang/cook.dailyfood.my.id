Chowmein generally has a slight twinge of sweetness, but if you don&#39;t like the sweet taste, you can skip adding sugar and tomato ketchup."
- "Add the boiled noodles to the wok. Mix with the help of 2 ladles or forks to coat them completely in the sauces."
- "Cook for a couple of minutes on high flame till the noodles are completely cooked."
- "Veg Chow Mein is ready. Serve it hot as a snack or along with any Indo-Chinese side dish."
