recipeinstructions:
- "Heat oven to 425째F"
- "Begin by salting the chicken and laying it skin side down in a cold skillet. Arrange the potatoes into the void spaces. Place over medium heat (3.8/6) for 18-25 minutes until the chicken skin browns and releases itself from the pan. This is the most patient part. If the chicken doesn&#39;t come off with relative ease using a spatula, leave it cook."
- "While the chicken is cooking, prepare the leeks. Remove any shriveled outter leaves and slice the leeks lengthwise and wash them under water to remove any sand in the leaves."
- "Cut the dark green tips off the leeks leaving the light green and white parts. Slice the leeks and add to a bowl"
- "Pick the fronds off the fennel and save them. We&#39;ll use them as a garnish later."
- "Cut the stalks off the fennel and discard."
- "Thinly slice the first 1/3 of the bulb and add to the leeks. Add the garlic to the leeks as well."
- "Slice the remaining leeks as thin as possible. If you have a mandolin, now is the time to use it. 1/16 inch slices. Place in another bowl. We&#39;ll dress this later as a raw salad on top of the chicken."
- "When the chicken releases from the pan, turn the heat off, remove the chicken and potatoes to a plate, leaving the rendered fat in the pan."
- "Add the harissa paste to the pan of hot chicken fat and stir to make a schmaltz."
- "Put the harissa schmaltz into a small bowl. Add 2 Tbsp of lemon juice and stir."
- "Return the pan to medium heat, add some olive oil and the leeks, fennel, and garlic. Season with salt and sprinkle the sugar on top. Carmelize the leeks over ~20 min, adding a bit of water if they begin to stick and burn."
- "When the leeks have cooked down and caramelized, add the chicken and potatoes to the skillet, skin side up. Roast ~10 min until the chicken thighs are cooked (165째F). Remove from oven."
- "Toss the fennel with a little salt, some pepper, 1 Tbsp lemon juice, and a drizzle of olive oil."
- "Add the fennel salad to the skillet. Drizzle the schmaltz over the chicken and garnish with the fronds and serve at the table in the skillet."
