recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE INGREDIENTS FOR THE CROCK POT Pull the Fullblood Wagyu top round roast from the freezer, and place in the refrigerator 2 days before making this recipe (so it is thawed completely). Bring the top round roast out of the fridge 1 hour before starting the recipe, so that it can reach room temperature. Cut the top round roast into 2-inch cubes.Add the chipotle en adobo, 2 cups beef stock, coriander, cumin, oregano, 3/4 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pep-per to the blender."
- "Blend ingredients well.Pour the liquid from the blender into a crock pot. Set the crock pot on low. Heat a large sauté pan with 2 tablespoons of avocado oil on medium-high heat. Season the pieces of top round roast with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Once the pan is hot, add 1/3 of the top round roast pieces, and sear the pieces for 3 minutes per side, getting deep cara-melization on all sides. Once the Fullblood Wagyu beef is caramelized, you will empty the pan into the crock pot."
- "Once the last of the beef is in the crock pot, put the sauté pan back on the burner. Sauté the julienned sweet onions until translucent.Then, add 1/2 cup of beef stock and the minced garlic to the pan. Let the liquid reduce, while using the wooden spoon to scrape the bottom of the pan. Once reduced, pour the pan ingredients into the crock pot with the beef. Mix all ingredients in the crock pot together. Cover and set the crock pot to low. Cook for 6-8 hours."
- "PREPARING THE SHREDDED FULLBLOOD WAGYU BEEF Once the Fullblood Wagyu top round roast has cooked for 6-8 hours, use a slotted spoon and transfer all of the beef chunks into a large bowl. Transfer the braising liquid from the crock pot to a sauce pot on the stove, and start reducing the liquid. You will want to reduce the braising liquid down to 2 cups. With two forks, shred the pieces of Fullblood Wagyu top round roast."
- "Then pour the reduced braising liquid into the bowl with the beef, coating all of the shredded beef. Season to taste with kosher salt, lime juice, and apple cider vinegar."

Then, add the mini sweet peppers and a 1/4 cup of water. Cook for 5 minutes or until the peppers are softened but not falling apart. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper. Reserve for serving"
