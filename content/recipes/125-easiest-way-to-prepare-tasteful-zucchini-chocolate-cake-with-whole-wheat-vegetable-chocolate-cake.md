- "Tips:  Don’t over mix the prepared batter. Don’t demould quickly allow it to cool down completely. Baking time may vary. Brown sugar can be replaced by white sugar.

- "Pressure Cooker Method:  Grease the baking tin with oil and dust it by sprinkling whole wheat flour over greased surface evenly. Pour the mixture into the greased baking tin.

- "If baking tin comes into direct contact with the base of the pressure cooker, it can burn (overbake) the cake.

Remove the gasket (rubber ring) from the lid."
- "Lower the flame after 2 minutes. Let it bake for 50 -60 minutes on low flame. After 60 minutes check the cake with a knife, if the mixture does not stick, it means the cake is done. If batter still sticks to knife then again bake for another 10 minutes. Do not open the lid immediately. Eggless Pressure Cooker Cake is ready."
