recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare your marinade. Pour your beer into a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add your garlic and Barbecue spice blend. Marinate for no longer than 12 hours."
- "Oil your baking pan and grill for 40 minutes until brown on both sides. I sprinkled a little Barbecue spice blend when it was almost done."
- "Wash your meat, add your curry, thyme, salt and knorr cubes. bring to boil. Separate the broth and fry in oil. However, you can use your chicken to make broth instead. Wash your rice. Do NOT parboil."
- "Blend your tomatoes, onions, scotch bonnets and bell peppers and boil. (Your blend can be smoother than mine if you don’t want bits and pieces of pepper in your jollof rice. Be liberal with your bell peppers as it accounts for the redness of your jollof rice."
- "Fry your pepper blend in the oil you fried the meat in. When it is fried, pour your broth and bring to boil for a few minutes. Stir and cook on maximum heat. (Many would fry onions in the oil first, but I’m not a big fan). Also I didn’t add any extra maggi or salt because my broth brought the flavors. But check and add more salt and knorr cubes as needed."
- "You may need to add more water as it cooks so don’t just leave it to burn. Yes, I allowed my jollof rice burn a little."
- "I love vegetables so I always add whatever is in my freezer. I did a vegetable dump, allowed it to steam and stirred. Turn down the heat and allow to simmer."
- "Allow your jollof rice steam a little even after you have put off the heat. Stir. Serve with grilled chicken and enjoy!"
