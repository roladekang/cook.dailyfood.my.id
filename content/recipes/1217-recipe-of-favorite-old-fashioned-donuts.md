- "Make the icing. Mix together the water and powdered sugar well. Roll the round donuts in the icing while still hot, then let cool."
- "Melt the chocolate in a double boiler or microwave. Spoon onto the donuts and let cool."
- "Cross section."
- "The more sugar you use, the easier it browns, so be careful."
- "If they&#39;re too hard, try adjusting the amount of ingredients, mixing method (don&#39;t over-mix!), dough thickness, oil temperature, and the frying time."
- "Adjust the amount of icing to taste. If you spoon some of the icing around the surface of the ringed donuts, then roll the donut holes around in the remaining icing, you shouldn&#39;t have leftovers."
