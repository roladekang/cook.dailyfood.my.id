recipeinstructions:
- "Wash and chop the veg. Heat a splash of oil and lightly sautÃ© the celery, onion and carrot (soffritto) and the bay leaf. I like to keep this chunky. Add the water, break the pasta, bring to the boil, reduce the heat and simmer until the pasta is almost cooked.

- "If you are using a large tomato you can grate this into the soup. For smaller tomatoes chop and add. Add the courgette and beans and any other veg. Use you judgement as to how long your veg needs to cook in the soup. You want to give them long enough to add flavour but you donâ€™t want them to be soggy."
- "Season to your taste and enjoy."
