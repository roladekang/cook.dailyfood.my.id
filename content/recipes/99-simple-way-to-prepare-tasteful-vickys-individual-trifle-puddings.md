- "While the jelly sets, start making the custard"
- "Birds brand in the UK is free from so you can use it to packet direction but change the milk for coconut (or soy) milk.

- "I like the contrast of both as using coconut cream &amp; coconut custard makes the whole dish quite coconutty obviously. I use vanilla extract to taste in the cashew cream plus a little powdered sugar to stiffen it up and I like to use almond extract in the custard to take the coconut edge off"
- "When the custard is cool enough divide it evenly between the bowls on top of the jelly layer. Let it chill in the fridge for 15 minutes to firm a bit"
- "Top with the cream"
- "Decorate the top with sprinkles or thinly sliced fruit. You can pipe coconut cream to make pretty embellishments but the cashew cream won&#39;t be quite thick enough. Chill until serving"
- "Depending on the size of bowls used you should get between 6 - 8 individual servings. As you can see I had 6 small bowls for the kids plus probably another 3 servings in a larger bowl as I had no more small! I also discovered I no longer have a pretty trifle bowl...."
