recipeingredient:
- "1/2 Lemon"
- "30 grams Butter"
- "10 grams Milk"
- "1 Egg large size"
- "40 grams White sugar"
- "30 grams Cake flour use 40 g if you dont have corn starch"
- "10 grams Cornstarch"
- "1/2 tsp Baking powder"
- "10 grams Lemon peel if available"
- " Icing"
- "1 Lemon flavored white coating chocolate"
recipeinstructions:
- "Lightly grease a pan with butter.  Wash the lemons well and grate the skins, and squeeze out the juice. Melt the butter in a hot water bath, combine with the milk, and keep warm in the hot water bath."
- "Beat the egg with a hand mixer inside a hot water bath at a high speed. Once it has become fluffy and bubbles have formed, add in the sugar over several turns and continue to beat."
- "Remove from the hot water bath once it&#39;s warm to the touch (about 40℃), and beat with a mixer until bubbles cover its blades. Finish it off by beating at a low speed for 1 minute until you end up with fine bubbles that are hard to pop."
- "Preheat the oven to 180℃. Sift  the • dry ingredients into step 3, add in lemon peel to taste, and give it a quick stir throughout."
- "Combine the melted butter that you&#39;ve been keeping warm, with the lemon juice and grated peel, add in one scoop of the batter from step 4, and stir. (The butter won&#39;t sink in easily)."
- "Drizzle the melted butter mixture from step 5 onto the surface of step 4, and stir in a wide circle while scraping up from the bottom of the bowl and rotating it. You should end up with a fluffy batter."
- "Fill the pan 90% of the way with the batter, and bake at 170-180℃ for 16-20 minutes. Drop the pan from a height of 10 cm after baking, remove from the pan, and let cool."
- "[Finishing Touches]:Melt the lemon flavored white chocolate in a hot water bath, and coat the cakes. Decorate with colored sugar dragées or lemon peel before it solidifies for a cute effect."
- "I had some leftover coating chocolate, so I used it as a topping on rusks, cranberry biscotti, and marshmallows, etc."
- "Icing tip 1: The coating chocolate won&#39;t have a nice texture if you heat it up to a high temperature. If melting it in a microwave, heat it for a short time."
- "Icing tip 2: Melt the coating chocolate at about 60℃, and keep warm in a 50-60℃ hot water bath to be able to cover the cakes smoothly."
- "Icing tip 3: if you want to cover the cakes with a thick layer of icing, take the icing out of the hot water bath to allow it to thicken, and then ice the cakes."
