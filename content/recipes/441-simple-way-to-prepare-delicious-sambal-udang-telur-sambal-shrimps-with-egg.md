- "Create a crater &amp; slide in an egg (this is optional, only 1 TBSP of egg white is used for marinading the shrimps, why not cook the whole egg too).  Cover &amp; cook until the egg white &amp; yolk cook to your preference.  Remove from heat &amp; garnish with scallions, coriander, or parsley.  You can serve this over steamed rice or deep fried Vietnamese rice paper."
- "To deep fry the Vietnamese rice paper, add about 1 inch of oil in a skillet.  Once the oil is heated up, carefully drop the paper into the oil.  It will crisp up immediately.  Remove from heat &amp; set aside to drain off excess oil.*  Serve immediately."
- "If you are not residing in Singapore, you can replace the sambal with any chili or hot sauce of your preference. Harissa, Sambal Oelek, or Thai Red Chili Sauce will be awesome as well."
