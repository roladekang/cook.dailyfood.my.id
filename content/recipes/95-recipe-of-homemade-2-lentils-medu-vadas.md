recipeinstructions:
- "Soak both Lentils for about 4 hours or more if time permits. I have soaked them at 6 in the morning and made in the evening at the same time. This way the batter was smooth and fluffy. Use as little water as possible."
- "Add rest of the ingredients to the batter and mix well. Heat Oil in a kadai. Take a Lemon sized lump of the batter and shape into a Medu Vada making a hole in the centre with your thumb. Grease your palms a bit with Oil or just plain water. Slide carefully into the hot Oil. Keep the heat to a low as you slide them. Increase it afterwards to a medium high heat to high heat as needed."
- "Deep fry them by changing the sides and keeping a watchful eye on them. They get done very easily and quickly too. Serve them piping hot with any Chutney of your choice. Enjoy!"
