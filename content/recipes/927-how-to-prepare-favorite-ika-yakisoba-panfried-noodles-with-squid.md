- "When everything is well mixed it&#39;s done! Optionally serve topped with aonori or a fried egg and so on."
- "The flavor of Worcestershire-style sauce differs by the brand, so adjust to taste."
- "Basically, it&#39;s OK to cook this without adding any oil, but if you&#39;re worried that it will stick, you can add some when you pan fry the noodles."
