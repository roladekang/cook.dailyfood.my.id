- "When the onions are just beginning to turn a light golden, add the potatoes and mix well for about 5 minutes over a medium heat."
- "Chuck in the sausages (sliced) and mushrooms, and mix to combine. the sausages will shrink a bit and release some of their fats into the pan."

- "Bake in the oven for about 12 minutes, till the edges of the eggs are set, but the top is still pretty much liquid."
- "Switch the oven to broiler mode, and continue cooking for another 3 to 4 minutes (broiler mode ensures that the top cooks evenly, while the rest of the frittata doesnt burn; cherry note the point. i tried my level best to tell u, but my wonderful connection kept going bust!)."
- "Anyhooo.... when the eggs are just set and not wobbly in the middle and the cheese is fully melted, ur frittata is done!"
- "Remove it from the oven and let it rest for just a minute. slice into individual portions and serve."
- "Tuck in!!!!"
