- "To begin making the Basundi Recipe, we will first have to condensed the milk. To do this, place the milk on high heat over a heavy bottomed sauce pan and bring it boil"
- "Add the sugar and stir continuously until the sugar dissolves. Once the sugar has dissolved and the milk is boiling vigorously for a few minutes reduce the heat to low and simmer the milk mixture stirring continuously until it is reduced to three fourths of it&#39;s original quantity. The condensation will cause the cream from the milk to settle on the sides and bottom of the pan. It&#39;s important to keep scraping down the cream and adding it back to the condensing milk."
- "The mixture will begin to thicken and get a creamy texture. It is important to make sure towards the end of the condensing process to be close to the stove monitoring the milk and stirring it continuously. The last stages are when the condensed milk can get burned at the bottom of the pan and completely alter the taste of the basundi."
- "Note Again: During the process of condensation of the milk, keep stirring the cream that keep forms, as it will stick to the sides and bottom of of them pan, while stirring keep scrapping down the sides and bottom to prevent burning of the cream."
- "Once the milk has reduced to half of it&#39;s original quantity, turn off the heat. The Basundi (Rabri) is almost ready. All you have to do now is to stir in the add saffron, pistachios powder and charoli."
- "Transfer the Basundi (Rabri) to a serving dish and allow it to cool before you can refrigerate for 3-4 hours."
- "Serve the Basundi (Rabri) hot or cold, during any season or serve it as a party dessert and enjoy."
- "Note: You can add fruits like Lychee&#39;s and Strawberries to make a delicious Strawberry Rabri or Lychee Rabri. And serve the Rabri chilled for the warm winter nights or after a spicy Indian Meal."
