recipeingredient:
- "1 can Starkist solid white albacore tuna IN WATER"
- "2 slice Publixs sandwich breads I used large white and perfer publixs brand due to its softness and fluff"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Hellmanns Real Mayonnaise"
- "1 dash of fresh chopped parsley"
- "1 packages of Natures Green Kale Greens"
recipeinstructions:
- "Set aside two slices of bread (I used enriched white for this one but you may use whole wheat)"
- "Mix one can of solid white tuna packaged in water with less than 2 tbsps of mayo. Caution: Do not use a can with oil or alternatives. This will defeat the purpose (think skin clearing)."
- "Now chop up fresh parsley leaves with stems and all and combine with the tuna and mayo. No need for any seasonings. Once combined the flavors will be delicious on its own."
- "Now let&#39;s layer!! First layer our Kale greens on top of our sliced breads, Secondly layer the mix bowl of tuna, mayo and parsley on top of the kale greens, lastly top with the second piece of bread and voila you&#39;ve got yourselves a great skin clearing tuna sandwich. Enjoy!!"
- "Check back with more ideas. Fyi (having a licensed paramedical esthetic background with a passion of anything that enhances our natural beauty I&#39;d thought you should know lol) Kale is known for the best leading skin clearing ingredient to date. Please do not substitute with Spinach as this may sound healthy as well but does cause acne. If your not prone to acne, eczema, or psoriasis breakouts then you should be okay with substituting kale for spinach. The combination of kale and parsley is wonderful for improving inflammation of the skin and not to mention tastes wonderful."
