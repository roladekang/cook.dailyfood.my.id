- "After preparing your buttermilk, next is your dry ingredients. Mix flour with vanilla essence, salt, baking soda and your cinnamon powder, stir a bit using your balloon whisk to combine. Set aside."

To prevent burning crust, while baking process, when you already find the great color of your cake, but the inside is still wet and undone, you could cover the top using a piece of parchment paper, and let it sit into the oven a bit longer around 5-10 minutes more without over baking crust."
- "After finish baking, let it cool inside the loaf around 5 minutes, and take it out, continue to let it cool over the cooling wire until completely cooled."
- "After that, chill it inside the fridge at least 1 hour. The best serving is after getting chilled. Enjoy! ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜ðŸ˜˜"
- "The texture after getting chilled and cut."
- "If you desire for the stronger taste of banana, feel free to add 1-2 more over ripe banana in it."
