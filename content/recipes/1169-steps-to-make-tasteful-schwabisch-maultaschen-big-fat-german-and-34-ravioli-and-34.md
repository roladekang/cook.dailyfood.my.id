recipeinstructions:
- "DOUGH: Combine flour with 2 eggs, 1/2 tsp salt and 4-6 Tbsp water in a bowl. Mix until dough comes together. Remove from bowl and knead on a floured surface until smooth. Wrap and let rest for 30 minutes."
- "FILLING: While the dough is resting, boil spinach for 1-2 minutes. Drain and dunk in very cold water. Squeeze out excess water and finely chop or process in a blender. (You can use the equivalent amount of frozen spinach as well)."
- "Mix the spinach, meat, minced onion, bread crumbs, egg, nutmeg and salt &amp; pepper together so everything is well blended."
- "METHOD 1 (Ravioli Style): Flour a working surface to roll out dough. Roll out thin into a large rectangle. Cut into smaller rectangles about 6 x 12 cm (2.5 x 5 in) with a knife or pie cutter."
- "Place a tablespoon of the filling on each dough rectangle, slightly off center. Fold over the dough and seal the pocket by pressing down around the meat filling."
- "Place on a floured tray or plate until all maultaschen are finished."
- "METHOD 2 (Rolled Maultaschen): This method is the easiest and fastest. Roll out the dough into one big rectangle (you might want to split the dough in half so it&#39;s more manageable) and spread the filling out evenly."
- "Roll up into a long roll. Seal the end with a little water."
- "Cut diagonally into thick pieces. The filling will be exposed but it will stay put when cooking if rolled up tightly."
- "METHOD 3 (Hybrid): Roll out the dough into one big rectangle and spread the filling out evenly, leave some space open on one side."
- "Fold into three, sealing the edge of the fold with a little water. Form square pockets by pressing down along the roll with the round handle of a wooden spoon. This will create a seal between each maultaschen."
- "Cut the pressed area with a knife or pasta cutter."
- "TO COOK: Bring the soup to a boil. Add the maultaschen and turn down to a simmer."
- "Simmer for 12-15 minutes. You can add a few veggies in the soup too if you like, though the &#39;classic&#39; way is to just enjoy in the broth."
- "Dish out into shallow bowls and pour over some broth (it doesn&#39;t have to be a lot, because you want to be able to cut the maultaschen). Garnish with chopped parsley."
