- "1 can tomato sauce"
- "2 lb lean ground beef"
- " base ingredients for lasagna"

- "1 large ricotta cheese"
- "2 lb shredded mozerella"
- "1 egg"
- "20 slice large pepperoni"
- "1 bunch chopped basil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Brown ground beef, make sure it is fine pieces. I break up meat with hands as I add it to the pan then I use a whisk as its cooking to break it up."
- "Because I&#39;m using a jar sauce I don&#39;t season meat with salt or pepper. When the sauce is cooked taste it, add salt then if it needs it."
- "Now for noodles. You can use regular lasagna noodles or the no boil variety. I find both to be just as good and the no boil is easier."
- "If you boil spray each noodle with cooking spray as you dropping into boiling water. This is what I do so they won&#39;t stick. Cook aldente( where noodle is not too soft, still a little firm. Then drain and rinse in cold water. Then leave them resting in cold water."
- "For no bake (easy way) put really hot tap water in a dish large enough to hold noodle. I use a rectangle dish. Soak noodles 10 min. They will not be completely soft. They will absorb moisture from cheese. But don&#39;t skip the soak. This recipe needs it."
- "Filling; beat egg mix with ricotta then add in most mozzarella leaving out 1 cup for the top. I don&#39;t add salt to this because the cheese already had it."
- "Assembly time; butter or spray Pam on bottom of a deep lasagna dish then coat bottom with two ladles of sauce."
- "Now lay noodles slightly over lapping the noodles. I usually use 5 for each layer. Leave 1/2 inch around the sides, this is so the sauce can fill the gap and envelop the noodles. Then spread the mixed cheese in an even layer over all the noodles. I drop spoonfuls all over then spread out."
- "Now add another layer of noodles then cheese. When you are near the middle do a layer of the pepperoni, use all of it. Also sprinkle some basil over some of the layers and save a bit for the top. Then repeat cheese noodles until all noodles and cheese mix are gone. DO NOT layer the sauce in. Just cheese and noodle."
- "Almost done; When you have your final layer of noodles pour sauce over the top letting it pour down the sides of the lasagna. Then sprinkle the chopped basil then top with the cup of mozzarella."
- "Spray foil with non stick and cover lasagna. Bake at 350° for about 30 min. Then take off foil and bake for 15 min or until the cheese is nicely browned."
- "I like to reserve some of the sauce and add another jar of marinara. I serve this warm next to the lasagna. I love sauce!"
- "Take lasagna out of the oven and let it rest for half an hour. This is hard to do but the lasagna will come out of the tray in a firmer slice. If you cannot let this set up it tastes fine but will be a runny mess."
- "Now I know some of you cooks may think this is a lot of meat in the sauce and yes it is. BUT this sauce needs to be thick and hearty. It is so good like this. You may also leave all the meat out for a vegetarian version. Or if you are serving a crowd and want your guests to have options use meatless marinara and serve the meat sauce on the side. Everyone I serve this too loves the thick meaty sauce."
