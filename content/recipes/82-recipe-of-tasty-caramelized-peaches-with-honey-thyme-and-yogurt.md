recipeingredient:
- "2 peaches"
- "2 tbsp sugar preferably dark"
- "1 tbsp honey"
- "1 little butter like a small walnut"
- " thyme"
- " strained yogurt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat the oven to 200°C."
- "While the oven reaches the desired temperature, cut the peaches into slices. I suggest you cut them into 6 slices each if you have large peaches or 4 if they are smaller."
- "Leave the butter for 5 minutes at room temperature so that you mix it with the sugar and honey. You should use a non-stick frying pan for that. Add the thyme to that too. It is better if you use a sprig of thyme so you can easily remove it 2-3 minutes later."
- "Cooking time on the stove is 2-3 minutes but you should stir constantly because it will be boiling vigorously."
- "Add the peach slices after 2-3 minutes on the stove, the inner part (close to the stone) should be at the bottom of the pan with the skin facing upwards. Make sure that you don&#39;t stir at all. The peaches should cook for 2 minutes in the sugar and honey mixture without any stirring at all."
- "Now the peach slices are ready for you to place them in baking dish for the second part. You should place the slices with the skin at the bottom and the inner part near the stone facing upwards."
- "Now, you have to be patient for 5 whole minutes so that the peach slices caramelize and their flesh gets a nice golden brown color. You can also &#34;help&#34; the process by pouring spoonfuls of the sugar and honey mixture on them."
- "Yummy! So, now it&#39;s time to serve it, together with its sauce and don&#39;t forget, the yogurt. You can also garnish your dish with an additional sprig of thyme. And how about some marjoram as well? Try it!"
- "Don&#39;t forget, it&#39;s best if you serve it cold! I am sure whoever tries it will enjoy it immensely!"
