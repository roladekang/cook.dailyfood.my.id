- "1/2 tbsp Olive oil"
- "1/2 tbsp White wine or sake"
- "10 grams Butter"
- "1 heaping tablespoon Apricot jam"
- "1/2 tsp Soy sauce"
recipeinstructions:
- "Spread out a large piece of plastic wrap and put on the chicken piece. Cover with another large sheet of plastic wrap (so the chicken is sandwiched between 2 sheets of wrap) and flatten with a rolling pin."
- "Keep pounding the chicken to make it thin and large. Keep on until the chicken is 3 times the original size (about 20 x 20 cm square)."
- "Remove the top piece of plastic wrap, and sprinkle the ☆ seasoning ingredients evenly over the chicken."

- "When the seam is well browned, brown the whole roll by rolling it around."
- "Add white wine and cover with a lid. Turn the heat down and steam-cook for 5-6 minutes."
- "Take the chicken roll out (don&#39;t wash out the frying pan) and slice about 1 to 1.5 cm thick. It&#39;s hot so don&#39;t burn yourself!"
- "Add ◆ butter to the frying pan and melt over low heat. Add apricot jam and soy sauce, and simmer to reduce while stirring."
- "Arrange the sliced chicken from Step 8 on a plate, pour the sauce from Step 9 over it and it&#39;s done."
- "If you serve the chicken with broccoli or other boiled vegetables or tomatoes, it will be colorful and look very festive. The grainy mustard and subtly sweet apricot jam are sublime."
