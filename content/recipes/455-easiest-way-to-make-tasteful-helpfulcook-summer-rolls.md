recipeingredient:
- " rice paper"
- " firm tofu"
- " lettuce leaves"
- " large carrot"
- " a cucumber"
- " mint leaves"
- " rice"
- " smooth peanut butter"
- " hoisin paste"
- " Juice of half a lime"
- " Soy sauce to marinade"
- " Cling film"
recipeinstructions:
- "Press the tofu and cut into 10 thin slices. Marinade in soy sauce for 10 minutes (or longer if you have the time and want a stronger flavour)."
- "Put the rice on to cook and fry the tofu in a pan for 5 minutes on each side. Once the tofu is done, set aside on a plate to cool."
- "Cut the carrot and cucumber into very slim strips, wash the lettuce and mint leaves."
- "While you&#39;re waiting for the rice and tofu to cook, make the sauce. Add the peanut butter, hoisin sauce and lime juice to a bowl. Gradually add boiling water whilst stirring continuously until the sauce has the consistency of double cream."
- "When the rice is done, drain it and rinse it with cold water. You&#39;re now ready to assemble the rolls."
- "To prepare for the assembling cover a baking tray and chopping board with cling film. This is important to stop the rolls sticking."
- "Before assembling each roll, soak the rice paper in water for about one minute or until it becomes soft. Do this simply by filling a large bowl/saucepan with water and dipping the paper in. Place the soft rice paper on the cling film-covered chopping board and put a piece of tofu in the middle. Next, wrap some carrot, cucumber, mint and rice in a lettuce leaf and put this on top of the tofu."
- "Now it&#39;s time to fold the roll. Fold one side into the middle, followed by the opposite one. Fold in one of the remaining sides, then roll the roll over onto the last side to seal it nice and tightly. Put the roll onto the cling film-covered baking tray and move onto the next one. Make sure the rolls do not touch, or they will stick together."
- "The rolls are eaten cold, so they can easily be prepared in advance. To eat you can use your hands and dip the rolls in the peanut sauce (consider a separate bowl of sauce per person!). Alternatively you can serve the rolls drizzled with peanut sauce and eat using a knife and fork."
