recipeingredient:
- "2 chicken breasts sliced into thin flat strips"
- "3 tbsp dessicated coconut"
- "3 tbsp panko breadcrumbs"
- " Salt and pepper to season"
- " For the dip"
- "1 tbsp organic runny honey"
- "1 tsp Dijon mustard"
- "2 tsp wine wine vinegar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Add the panko breadcrumbs and dessicated coconut to a bowl and dredge the chicken strips in it, making sure to cover every section evenly so no flesh is showing by patting it gently all over. Add the strips to a large plate once coated."
- "Preheat the oven to 180 degrees or gas mark 6. Place the chicken tenders over foil lined baking tray on a wire cooking rack. This is to ensure the tenders remain nice and crispy when cooking and don&#39;t become soggy."

- "Once the chicken is ready, remove from the oven and allow to cool for a couple of minutes. Transfer to your serving plate with the dip and serve! These are great on their own as a party food or meal or also pair well with homemade coleslaw or fries. :)"
