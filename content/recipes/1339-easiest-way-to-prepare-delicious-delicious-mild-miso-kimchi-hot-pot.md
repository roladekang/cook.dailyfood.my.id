- "Add the tofu and shimeji, put the lid back on and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. I actually added some leftover leek this time."
- "Add the chives and lightly spoon the soup over the ingredients. Cover again and heat for about 5 minutes."
- "Once the chives are cooked through, it&#39;s done."
- "For the last bite of the meal, you can add some udon or rice porridge; either one goes well with the soup. Today, I added beaten egg over udon."
