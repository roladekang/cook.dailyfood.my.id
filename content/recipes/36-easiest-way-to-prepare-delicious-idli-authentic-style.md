recipeingredient:
- "750 ml idli batter made using the link given below           see recipe"
- "3 tsp salt if the batter is totally saltless"
- "40-45 ml water to adjust consistency"
- " To serve with"
- "1 cup Sambhar"
- "as needed Unrefined peanut oil"
- "1 cup Coconut chutney"
recipeinstructions:
- "Add salt and water in the batter, a little water at a time as needed(I have given the exact measurement of water, yet it largely depends on how much water you used while grinding the batter.). Combine very gently without disturbing the air bubbles in the batter. The batter should be thick, but at pouring consistency."
- "Prepare the steaming pit by putting some water in it to heat up. Meanwhile, brush some oil in each section of the idli tray. Pour idli batter in each section. Do not fill it till the very top as it spreads as the idli puffs."
- "If the water in the steaming pit is boiling or if the steaming pit is full of steam, it&#39;s ready ! Place the idli tray in it and cover it quickly so the steam does not escape. Cook for 7-10 minutes on medium high flame. Meanwhile prepare another tray of idli for steaming."
- "Take the tray out of the steaming pot and rest for 3-5 minutes. Then remove the idlis gently using a sharp knife or a sharp spoon. You need to run the sharp object all around to help idli release the tray and then lift it up gently."
- "If the idli breaks while lifting or if the edges of the idlis are not neat enough, understand that it is still too hot to work with. See pic 2 Vs pic 3 below.  Flat and hard, it suggests that the batter did not ferment well. Or the batter is too thin.  If the idlis are sour, understand that the fermentation time of the batter was extended."
- "Avoid putting 2 trays of idlis on the top of each other. The steam water that gets collected on the top most tray falls on the second tray and that&#39;s how the idlis in the second tray get soggy. For the same reason, avoid covering the steaming pot with a flat surface. Doom shaped cover is preferred because the shape helps the steam water to roll down easily, rather than falling on the idlis."
