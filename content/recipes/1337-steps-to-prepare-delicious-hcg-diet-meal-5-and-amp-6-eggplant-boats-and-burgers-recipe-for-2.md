- "4 medium eggplants about 120130 g after removing pulp"
- "4 small rounds of beef taken from 100 g raw meatballs"
- "8 cherry tomatoes or 16 bits of tomatoes"
- "1 bunch chopped parsley"
- "1 red onion"
- "1 tsp spice mix salt paprika coriander cinnamon mixed spice 14 tsp sugar"
- "1/2 cup water"
- "2 large and medium pieces of tin foil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cut eggplant in half and take out the seeds along with some of the middle meat and make it like a boat, don&#39;t take out too much."
- "Weigh each half separately in order to know how much of the other veggies to add on. sprinkle some of the spices and chop the veggies like in the picture. thin onion bits, length ways for the tomatoes and chop parsely and garlic."
- "Now we have the 4 balls 100 g of minced beef. take a bit out of every ball just for the stuffing about 1 tbs, the rest will be used for the second half of the dish below. this is for 2 people, lunch and dinner."
- "Start loading your boats. onions, garlic, tomato strips, beef ball patted out, tomatoes then parsely and spices. the beef ball should be about 1 tbs."
- "Put the medium sized foil at the bottom of the pan as we won&#39;t use any oils. then place the eggplants in the pan and in the oven for about 30 minutes."
- "30 minutes later add the water (1 or 1/2 a cup) and cover for an additional 20 minutes. we need to make sure the eggplant and beef are well cooked. this step will create sauce as well."
- "Use the rest of the 100 g beef to make burger patties. stuff them with some of the onions and make a ball then pat it out and cook directly in a hot pan with no oils. nonstick pans work best. gently nudge and flip over after 3 -4 minutes when the meat is hard enough so it wouldn&#39;t break then cover and cook on low heat for about 20 minutes and flip the burgers in between."
- "Finally have 1 beef patty and 1 eggplant boat together for one meal. you should weigh the vegetables if ur sticking to 200 g veggies."
- "Update on HCG drops diet, although they were amazing for both rounds I had to stop using them. I got breast pains every time I tried but it was nothing serious, so be careful that by time your body might not accept it."
