- "Put the egg whites in a mixing bowl. Check to make sure bowl and beaters are completely clean and dry. (The smallest trace of yolk, water, or fat can prevent the whites from obtaining maximum volume.) Beat egg whites until foamy. Gradually add in sugar (in 3 batches), beating on high speed until frothy and stiff peaks form. you can test by lifting beaters straight up from egg whites.

- "When the cake is done, remove from oven then invert the pan onto table until completely cooled. This is a very important step so the cake will not sink."
- "Take the cake out of the pan and slice. Serve it as is or with whipped cream or ice cream. Enjoy."
