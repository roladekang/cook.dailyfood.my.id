recipeingredient:
- "180 grams  Cake Flour"
- "20 grams  Katakuriko"
- "20 grams  Almond flour"
- "1/2 tsp  Salt"
- "30 grams Unsalted butter"
- "50 grams Cream cheese"
- "1 tsp Lemon juice"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- "1 Egg yolk medium"
- "40 grams Strawberry flavored chocolate"
recipeinstructions:
- "Bring the butter, egg, and cream cheese to room temperature. Melt the strawberry flavored chocolate in a double boiler."
- "Combine the ⚫ ingredients (cake flour, katakuriko, almond powder, and salt) in a bowl and instead of sifting, whisk briskly with a whisk."
- "Whisk unsalted butter and cream cheese until creamy, add lemon juice and whisk well again. Add sugar and whisk until it looks white."
- "Add the egg yolk and melted chocolate to the bowl from Step 3 and whisk again."
- "Add the dry ingredients from Step 2. Using a spatula, mix the dough in a cut and fold motion."
- "When the dough is crumbly, pack it together with your hands, and fold in the dough by pressing down with your hands until the dry ingredients have been well integrated."
- "Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 170℃. Take out the chilled dough to form into shapes."
- "Roll the dough into coin-sized balls in the palms of your hands. Press down on them slightly before  organizing them in rows on a parchment-lined baking tray, with space in between. Make sure that there are no cracks on the surface of the dough."
- "Bake in the preheated 170℃ oven for 20 minutes (I use an electrical stove). Let the cookies cool on the tray, and you&#39;re all done."
- "You can enjoy them as they are, or coat them in powdered sugar."
- "Melt chocolate in a double boiler (if you temper the chocolate, it&#39;ll bring out the shine). Dip half of the cookies into the chocolate. Let the coating harden while resting the cookies on a rack."
- "Before the chocolate hardens completely, decorate your cookies with sprinkles or dragées. I&#39;ve added food coloring to the cookies shown here."
- "You can also make chocolate-coated cookies by drizzling on the tempered strawberry chocolate with your right hand, while holding a cookie on a fork with your left hand."
- "I drew on these cookies with a decoration pen once the coating hardened. You can use a toothpick to draw fine lines. Little pigs are a cute choice, as well as..."
- "puppies, pandas, or..."
- "if you get tired, feel free to draw random designs..."
- "Please try out different designs. Just as a reference, I was able to decorate 10 cookies using 40 g of strawberry flavored chocolate for the coating."
- "[For the pink colored dough] The cookies will have a light hue, so if you want a bolder color like I&#39;ve shown in Step 11, add diluted food coloring at Step 4."
- "(Step 18 continued) If using food coloring, cover the cookies midway through baking to prevent browning."
- "Instead of using decorating pens, I used mini chocolate chips for the eyes. These piggies are looking sexy with their falsies."
