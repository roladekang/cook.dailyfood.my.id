recipeingredient:
- "6 chicken legs thigh and drumstick connected"
- "6 sprigs Fresh rosemary"
- "3 sprigs Fresh sage"
- " kosher salt"
- " pepper"
- "4 tsp herbs de provence"
- "1 medium shallot diced"
- "1 tbsp rosemary leaves minced"
- "1 garlic clove minced"
- "1 cup chicken stock"
- "1 tbsp gelatin"
- "1 tbsp lemon juice"
- "1 tsp white wine vinegar"
- "1 tbsp unsalted butter"
- "1 tbsp soy sauce"
- "1 dash sherry wine"
recipeinstructions:
- "Set sous vide bath to 160F. Season chicken legs generously with salt pepper and 2 tsp herbs de provence."
- "Place the thighs in vaccum sealed bags. Face them all in the same direction and place your rosemary snd sage on the side of the leg where there is no skine covering. Placing the herb on the exposed flesh will help to season the meat and not just the skin. Sprinkle some olive oil over top the chicken. Then seal."
- "Place bag/bags in preheated sous vide bags. Cook for at least 1 hour and up to 4 hours. Yes that&#39;s my homemade sous vide machine. The circulator was in sale for $150 and the cooler costs $25. I stole this design from somewhere on the internet, but it works out and the cooler keeps heat in so your circulator is not running the whole time."
- "Remove the chicken from your bath. Dunk the bag of chicken in ice water and leave for five minutes."
- "Remove the chicken from the bag and retain the juices inside. Pat the chicken dry and remove the whole herbs from the chicken. Put the dried chicken in the fridge while you prep for the pan sauce, or about 15 minutes."
- "Chop your shallot, garlic clove, and rosemary, pour 1 tbsp of gelatin over your chicken stock and set aside. Remove the chicken from the fridge and reseason if you think too much of the seasoning was washed away while cooking. Put a tbsp of olive oil into a cast iron pan and heat over medium high until smoking."
- "Add the chicken, skin down to the pan. Use another pan to keep weight on the chicken while it cooks, so you can get maximum brownage. You&#39;re look at about 2 minutes per side."
- "When complete throw your shallot, rosemary and garlic in the still hot pan. Cook until fragrant."
- "Then pour your chicken stock and the reserved juices from your vacuum nag into the pot. Using a wooden spatula scrape up any browned bits that may be stuck to the bottom of the pan. Cook over medium high heat until reduced to about 2/3&#39;s the original volume."
- "Add soy sauce, lemon juice, sherry wine, white wine vinegar and butter. Boil rapidly until you have a smooth creamy sauce. Dip a spoon into your pan sauce, if it coats the back of the spoon you&#39;re good to go. If not keep boiling."
- "Run the pan sauce through a fine mesh strainer or chinois. You can press down on the bits stuck in the strainer to get some really tasty juice back into you pan sauce."
- "Serve the pan sauce over chicken and enjoy you&#39;re fancy sous vide chicken."
