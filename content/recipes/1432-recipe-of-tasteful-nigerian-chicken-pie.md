recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare all the needed Ingredients. Peel and wash your potatoes; wash, scrape and dice your carrots and scrape the carrots. Peel and slice your onions as well."
- "Under medium heat, gently stir your shredded chicken until it’s half-cooked. Add 2 cups of water, chicken cubes and mix thoroughly. Now bring all to a boil and then add the diced carrots and potatoes. Let everything boil until it’s properly cooked."
- "Dissolve 4 tablespoons of flour in 1 cup of cold water and add to the meat pie filling. This tip is so that the chicken pie filling does not dry up during baking. Also, this secret is what keeps your pie looking juicy and moist after baking. Add your salt to taste, turn off your cooker and set aside to cool"
- "Time to prepare our Dough"
- "Put the flour, baking powder and little salt in a large bowl- you would want to use a deep bowl with a round surface. It helps with working your dough. You would want to thoroughly mix these dry ingredients very well because it’s the foundation for a good pie."
- "Now add your margarine bits by bits. You don’t want to be overwhelmed during kneading. It would be easier to work your dough if added in smaller quantities. Mix until crumbs are formed. If you don’t get crumbs then you need to check if you used the right Margarine not butter since butter hardens the dough; Or if the Margarine was left outside the fridge at least 2hours before use."
- "Now, add your cold water step by step to avoid drowning your dough. You would be surprised at how little water is needed to form your dough. Knead the dough very well, put back in the bowl and leave to rest for 10minutes. This makes a more workable dough."
- "Set your oven to 170°C (335°F) and leave to preheat while you continue with the meat pie. Rub margarine on the insides of the oven tray and set aside. This is so that the undersides of the meat pies do not burn or stick to the tray during baking."
- "Break the egg, beat it and set aside, you will need it pretty soon. Knead the dough some more, roll it out to achieve a 5mm thickness. Use a cutter, be it the cover of a small pot or a pie cutter, to make round cuts on the rolled out dough. Remove the excess dough, leaving behind the round cuts."
- "Scoop some pie filling into the center of the round cuts, the quantity should be such that you can comfortably close the dough without overflows. Practice makes perfect so you would get the hang of it."
- "Rub the egg on the inside edge of the cut Chicken pie dough. This is to ensure that your meat pie is perfectly sealed and does not open up while it is being baked. Fold one part of the dough to meet the other end and use a fork to press the 2 edges together to close tightly. Place your pie in the oven tray and repeat the previous step till all the cut out dough is exhausted. Rub the egg on the meat pies. This gives the meat pie a golden brown look when done."
- "Set on your bake tray and start baking. Your baking time takes anywhere from 30-50minutes depending on what type of oven you have. But make sure to place your tray at the medium level in your oven. You don’t want to set it high up or too low to prevent it burning and been undercooked."
