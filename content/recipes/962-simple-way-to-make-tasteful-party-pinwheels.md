- " cream cheese 8oz each  softened low fatno fat is fine"
- " your fave ranch dressing mix or 1 envelope such as Hidden Valley"

- " can green chiles  drained"
- " jar chopped pimentos  drained"
- " burrito size flour tortillas"
- " parchment or waxed paper for wrapping rollups"
recipeinstructions:
- "Do a little prep! Drain as much liquid as possible from pimentos, olives and green chiles. We don&#39;t want soggy roll ups! Cut 6 pieces of wax paper, big enough to wrap around roll ups and twist on ends. Set all aside."
- "In a large bowl cream together cream cheese and ranch mix until well incorporated and smooth (no large chunks of cream cheese remain). Gently stir in black olives, chiles and pimentos until well combined."
- "Let&#39;s Roll! Working one at a time lay a tortilla out in front of you on a clean surface. Place one sixth of the cream cheese mixture on the side of tortilla closest to you. Using a knife or offset spatula (i.e. frosting spreader) spread mixture into an even layer all over tortilla. Spread all the way to edges, except for side farthest from you. Leave about 1/4&#34; bare for any overflow while rolling."
- "Beginning near you roll edge of tortilla over itself, then continue to roll away from you ensuring tortilla is tightly rolled without squeezing any filling out the sides. Once rolled, wrap in prepped parchment or waxed paper, twisting ends to seal and set aside on platter. Repeat with remaining tortillas and mixture. When all are done place in fridge for at least 2 - 3 hours, up to overnight, to firm up and allow flavors to blend."
- "To serve, working one at a time again, unwrap each rollup cut off &#34;ugly ends&#34;, (about 1/4&#34;of each side. Just save those as the chef&#39;s treat lol), then cut into 1/2&#34; - 3/4&#34; wide slices. Arrange slices on serving platter cut side up, stacking if necessary is ok, Set &#39;em out and watch &#39;em disappear!"
