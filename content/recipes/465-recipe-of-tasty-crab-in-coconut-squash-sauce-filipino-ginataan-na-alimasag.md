recipeinstructions:
- "Saute garlic, ginger, and onions in oil in a deep pan or wok."
- "Add the coconut milk. Add the cubed squash. Chop off the bottom stems (thick and hard parts) of the kangkong/water spinach. Get the leaves and young stems only, chop coarsely. Add to the pan."
- "Simmer and cover until squash is tender. Mash squash coarsely with spatula. Season with patis (fish sauce, few drops), salt and pepper to taste."

Don&#39;t remove the claws as well if ever, as the fat will seep out of the shell."
