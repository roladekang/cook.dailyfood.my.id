recipeingredient:
- "1 lb ground pork"
- "1 lb ground beef"
- "2 slice fresh white bread wthe crusts cut off"
- "1/4 cup whole milk"
- "5 tbsp butter"
- "1/2 cup finely chopped onion"
- "1 tsp salt or more to taste"
- "2 large egg yolks"
- "1/2 tsp fresh ground black pepper"
- "dash cinnamon"
- "dash nutmeg"
- "33/100 cup allpurpose flour"
- "3 1/2 cup beef broth"
- "1 packages egg noodles"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 200°F."
- "Tear the bread into pieces and place in a small mixing bowl and cover with the milk. Make sure it&#39;s absorbing but not saturated.  Add a little more milk if necessary, just not too much.  Set aside."
- "In a 12-inch straight sided sauté pan or electric frying pan.  I prefer electric as you can control the heat better.  Over medium heat, melt 2 tablespoons butter. Add the onion, a pinch of salt, a little pepper and sweat until the onions are soft, about 5-7 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside."
- "In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the bread and milk mixture, ground beef, pork, egg yolks, 1 teaspoon of kosher salt, black pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and onions. Beat on medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes."
- "Roll meat in to small balls, very small, bite sized and place on a large cutting board lined with wax paper."
- "Heat another 1-2 tablespoons of butter, in the same pan that was used for the onions, over medium-low heat, or in an electric skillet set to 300°F. Add the meatballs and sauté until golden brown on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes. You want them nice and browned.  Remove the meatballs to an ovenproof dish using a slotted spoon.  Cover and place in the warmed oven."
- "Once all of the meatballs are cooked, decrease the heat to low and add the flour to the pan or skillet that was used for sautéing the meatballs. Whisk until lightly browned.  It will be thick and lumpy.  Approximately 1 to 2 minutes. Gradually add about half of the beef stock, raise the heat a little and whisk until sauce begins to simmer and thicken.  Add the rest of the beef stock and simmer for 1-3 more minutes.  Remove the meatballs from the oven, cover with the gravy and serve over buttered egg noodles."
- "Tips:                                                                                                          This recipe yields about 100 meatballs depending on size. It is important they are bite sized.  I tend to roll them in batches as I brown them.  I can get about 25-30 in the pan at a time.  If you don&#39;t do both simultaneously it can take 2 hours or more to prepare.  If you cook early you can turn off the oven and leave the meatballs in there for easy heating later.  They can sit in the oven a long time without drying out.  If your sauce is too thick add a little more beef stock.  If it&#39;s to thin dilute some flour into cold beef stock and add to the sauce slowly and simmer until you reach the desired consistency."
