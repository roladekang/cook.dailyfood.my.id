- "1 Onion"
- "1 cup Cream"
- "1 cup Buttet"
- "1/4 cup Olive Oil"
recipeinstructions:
- "Take both chicken breasts and slice them open down the middle. This will make 4 smaller breasts. Cover with cling film and pulverise them. Once flattened coat them in the plain flour (either side). In a deep frying pan melt the olive oil and 1/2 cup of butter. Add the chicken to the pan, sprinkle over with salt and pepper, at a low - medium heat and allow to cook until golden brown on either side. Remove and place to the side."
- "In the meantime using the same pan and leftover oil add the rest of the butter and garlic. Let it combine then toss in your chopped onions and chopped red peppers, cook for a couple of minutes, frequently stirring. Then pop in your tomatoes. Leave for another minute. At this point pour in your chicken stock."
- "Allow it to come to the boil then turn heat to low. Now add your cream. Give it a good stir. That’s the sauce ready so let’s add the chicken to it.  Just before your ready to serve put the 2 cups of fresh spinach in. Never add the spinach too early as it just gets soggy and loses all its goodness."
- "That’s it ready to serve. I played it up with some white, fluffy boiled rice. It would also be great with all types of potatoes - mashed, roasted or baked. Whatever you fancy!"
