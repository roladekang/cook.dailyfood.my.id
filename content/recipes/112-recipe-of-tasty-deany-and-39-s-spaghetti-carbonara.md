recipeinstructions:
- "In a pot on medium high heat, add the water and bring to a boil. Once water is boiling add a generous amount of salt. Then add the pasta and cook as per the instructions on the packet."
- "In a bowl add the eggs (use more eggs if you prefer it more creamy) and grate parmesan cheese. Mix together until well incorporated and set aside."
- "In one pan on medium heat, add one tablespoon olive oil and the onions. Cook the onions until soft and translucent and set aside. I"
- "In another pan, add a tablespoon of olive oil. Add the aubergine and cook to desired softness. Once cooked, transfer to a small bowl lined with paper towel, drain off any excess oil."
- "In a wok on high heat, add the butter and let it melt a little. Then add the bacon slices, cook for two minutes and then add the sautéed onions and peas, constantly stirring to avoid burning. Once bacon is fully cooked and to desired crispiness, turn heat to very low."
- "Check the pasta if this is cooked. When the pasta is ready, using a pasta fork or tongs lift it from the water and transfer it in the wok with the bacon, onions and peas. Tip: do not throw away the pasta water, keep this for later."
- "Remove wok from the heat, quickly pour in the eggs and parmesan mixture. Using a fork or tongs lift the spaghetti so it mixes in with the egg and cheese mixture easily. This ensure all of the spaghetti is evenly coated and the eggs does not get scrambled."
- "Add 2-3 tablespoons extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy. Tip: you don’t want the carbonara wet, just moist. Then season to taste with salt and black pepper."
- "Use a long-pronged fork or tongs to twist the pasta on to a serving bowl (ideally a pasta bowl). Add a few pieces bacon pieces on top and sautéed aubergine slices around the pasta. Serve immediately while hot and garnish with a sprinkling of parmesan cheese and grate over extra black pepper (optional). Tip: if pasta gets a little dry before serving, splash in some more hot pasta water. This helps revive the pasta back to the glossy sauciness."
