- "1/2 block Firm tofu"
- "1 bunch Garlic chives"
- "2 tbsp Sesame oil for stir frying"
- "1 tsp Dashi soup stock granules"
- "1 1/2 tbsp Miso"
recipeinstructions:
- "Separate the cabbage into core and leaves, and cut into 1 to 2 cm strips. Break the tofu into bite-size pieces, roughly shred the shimeji, and cut the chives into 7 to 8 cm pieces."
- "Heat the sesame oil in a frying pan. Add in kimchi and stir-fry thoroughly."
- "Once the kimchi is cooked through, add the pork and continue stir-frying."

- "Once the core is cooked through, add the leaves and continue simmering for about 5 minutes."
- "Check the taste at this point since water starts to come out from cabbage. If it seems too watery and lacks in taste, add a bit of salt."
- "Add the tofu and shimeji, put the lid back on and simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. I actually added some leftover leek this time."
- "Add the chives and lightly spoon the soup over the ingredients. Cover again and heat for about 5 minutes."
- "Once the chives are cooked through, it&#39;s done."
- "For the last bite of the meal, you can add some udon or rice porridge; either one goes well with the soup. Today, I added beaten egg over udon."
