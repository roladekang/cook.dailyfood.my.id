recipeinstructions:
- "The main goal is to eliminate as much water as possible so we don’t get steam pockets when cooked. We also want everything to be chopped as finely as possible so we don’t get poky bits damaging our wrappers."
- "Drain tofu and squeeze all the water out by wrapping it in paper towels or a tea towel and placing it on top of two plates (small plate face down on big plate) and putting a heavy pot on top."
- "Medium heat, large pan. Cook the carrot first but don’t let it brown. Add ginger and oniony things and cook for a few seconds only. Add the mushrooms and cook until water is out."
- "Add the dry noodles - cut into small pieces with scissors or by crunching with your hands. Add the greens and crumble the tofu in. The water from the greens and tofu should go into the noodles to soften them."
- "Add soy sauce, white pepper, and sesame oil to taste. Dissolve the bouillon in 1/4 cup hot water (can be strained mushroom soaking water) and the corn starch in 1/4 cup cold water and add them too."
- "Cook it down until it has a texture almost like couscous. Let it cool and you can even freeze it."
- "Scatter corn meal on a pan or plate to prevent sticking. Fold dumplings however you like but make sure they are sealed well."
- "Cooking methods: 1) Steamed (like din tai fung and common for Tibetan momo). Less disastrous if your seals aren’t the best. I don’t have experience but I bet using steaming paper or piling the bottoms will prevent sticking."
- "2) Boiled: better with thick homemade wrappers. Most disastrous if not properly sealed. When you take them out, pour oil on top and jiggle until every dumping moves so they don’t stick together."
- "3) Deep fry: I think this is more American? but also disastrous if not properly sealed. I’ve never done this but I bet it is deliciously crispy, especially with store bought wrappers."
- "4) Basted (Japanese style): mix a tiny bit (1/2 tsp?) of corn starch and 1/2 cup cold water and a dash of soy sauce. Oil nonstick pan and arrange gyoza in a pattern. Pour in slurry and cover. When the skins are transparent, uncover and let the liquid boil off. When the bottoms are crispy, jiggle the pan to loosen and flip onto a plate. Not bad if not properly sealed."
- "Alternative fillings include: 1) More Japanese version of gyoza: Everything above but use Napa cabbage instead of the power greens and omit the corn starch. When you chop the cabbage, generously sprinkle salt and put in a strainer to get some water out. Don’t cook before folding. I don’t like this one because the Napa can be big and poky and difficult to put in wrappers."
- "2) Texture lovers: Carrot and muer mushroom finely chopped and seasoned with white pepper and soy sauce. You can add cooked down greens and bean noodles too."
- "3) Breakfast jiaozi: Scrambled egg and jiucai. Whisk the egg and add some soy sauce and bouillon and white pepper. Fry the jiucai in oil and add the egg. Fry it down and cut into tiny pieces."
- "Sauces: 1) Japanese style: “Chinese” hot mustard (in quotes because that’s what they call it but I’ve never seen it in China, Taiwan, or Chinese restaurants, so I dunno if it’s actually Chinese) and soy sauce mixed together.  2) One I had in China: soy sauce, dark Chinese vinegar, ginger, garlic, green onion 3) Basically anything goes! Vegan lahtt sauce plus soy  sauce is also delightful."
