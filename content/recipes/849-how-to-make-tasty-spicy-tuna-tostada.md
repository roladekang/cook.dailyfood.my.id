recipeinstructions:
- "In a bowl, combine soy sauce, lime juice, and ginger. Marinate the tuna in this, turning ocassionally to fully impregnate."
- "For the spicy mayo: ideally, you&#39;d use Pequin pepper powder, but that&#39;s not always easy to find, so you can substitute with Cayenne pepper, as we did here. Add the powder to the mayonnaise and mix well."
- "Next, cut the leek in half and slice it into half-moons, as thinly as possible."

- "Using the same skillet (caution: very hot), heat the olive oil and sear the tuna. No more than one minute per side! Then, transfer to a cutting board and slice it as thinly as possible."
- "Spread the spicy mayo on each tostada and distribute the tuna slices on them."
- "Add 1/4 of the avocado on each tostada and top with a generous pinch of fried leek. Voilá! Enjoy!"
