recipeinstructions:
- "PREPARING THE FULLBLOOD WAGYU STEAK:Whisk together the milk and the eggs in a shallow dish. In another dish, mix the flour with the kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper, smoked paprika, and cayenne pepper. Cut the Fullblood Wagyu top round steak (tenderized) into 2 inch x 3 inch steaks. Season the steak on both sides with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.Working with one 2 inch x 3 inch steak at a time, place the steak in the flour mixture."
- "Turn to coat. Then, place the steak into the milk and egg mixture, while turning to coat. Let it drain off. Finally, place the steak back in the flour mixture and turn to coat (so the process is dry mixture, wet mixture and dry mix-ture again). Place the breaded steak on a clean plate. Repeat with the remaining steaks, and place the breaded steaks on the plate – do not stack the steaks on top of each other.Heat the grapeseed oil in a large stainless steel sauté pan over medium heat."
- "Add the butter to the pan. When the butter starts to sizzle, it’s ready for the breaded steak. (NOTE: It should not brown right away. If it does, the fire/heat is too hot.) Cook 3 pieces of breaded steak at a time for around 2 minutes per side. Cook until each side is golden brown.Remove the cooked Fullblood Wagyu steaks to a plate lined with paper towels. Keep the chicken fried steaks warm by covering them lightly with a foil sheet. Repeat the process until all of the steaks are cooked."
- "PREPARING THE GRAVYAfter all of the Fullblood Wagyu steaks are fried, pour off the fat (from the pan) into a heat-proof bowl. Wipe out the skillet, and return it to the stove over medium heat.Add 1/4 cup of the fat back to the skillet. Add 2 tablespoons of butter to the skillet as well, and allow it to heat up.When the fat is hot, sprinkle the flour evenly over it. Using a whisk, mix the flour with the fat, creating a golden brown paste (roux)."
- "Add more flour if it looks overly greasy, and add a little more butter if it becomes too pasty/clumpy. Keep cooking for 2-3 minutes until it reaches a deep golden brown color.Add in the milk slowly, while whisking constantly.Add the kosher salt, cayenne pepper, and garlic powder to the skillet.Add the freshly ground black pepper to taste. Cook for 5-10 minutes, while whisking, until the gravy is smooth and thick.You may need to whisk in more milk if the gravy is too thick."
- "PREPARING THE MASH POTATOES Peel the potatoes, and cut them into 1/2 inch cubes. Place them in a large stock pot, and cover them by 2 inches with cold water. Add in 2 tablespoons of kosher salt, and bring to a boil on medium-high heat. Once the potatoes are boiling, reduce to a simmer. Cook for 10-15 minutes or until potatoes are soft and can be easily pierced with a fork. Drain off all of the water, and place the potatoes in a medium-size bowl."
- "Mash them with a potato masher, or run them through a food mill. Heat the heavy cream and butter in a small sauce pan until the butter has melted. Pour all but a 1/2 cup of the cream and butter mixture into the bowl with the potatoes. Stir until mixed. Add the rest of the cream and butter mixture, if needed, to make smooth mashed potatoes. Season to taste with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper."
- "FINAL STEPS Serve the chicken fried Fullblood Wagyu top round steak warm over the mashed potatoes. Drizzle the steak and potatoes with gravy.Enjoy"
