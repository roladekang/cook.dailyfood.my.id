- "Cut the nori seaweed into narrow rectangles and fold around the bottom of the onigiri."
- "Make the horns from boiled carrot and the facial features from nori seaweed. (Cut them out out with either a small pair of scissors or a craft punch.) Make the cheeks from imitation crab sticks (cut them out with a straw)."
- "Stick the horns right into the onigiri. Push them in far enough so that they don&#39;t fall back out."

- "Instead of making the hair with dried bonito flakes and soy sauce I think mince meat, tuna mayonnaise or scrambled egg would be cute too."
- "The hair may fall off when transferring the onigiri to a lunchbox so I recommend adding a dollop of mayonnaise at the base of the horn to stick the hair in place."
