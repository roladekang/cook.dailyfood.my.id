recipeinstructions:
- "MAKE THE MEATBALLS:   In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the onion in the oil for about 15 minutes, until fragrant and beginning to brown.  Stir in the garlic and cook 1 minute more.  Remove from heat."
- "Mix onion/garlic mixture together with the rest of the meatball ingredients.  Mix well.  I find it&#39;s easiest to use my hands, kind of squishing it all through my fingers, to thoroughly distribute everything."

Add the butter and mushrooms and cook over medium-high heat until browned.  Add seasonings to taste and the white (bottom) part of the sliced green onions.  (The green onion tops will be added later.)"
- "MAKE THE SAUCE:  Stir the cornstarch into the beef broth.  Pour over the mushrooms and bring to a boil stirring until thickened, about 2 minutes.  Reduce heat to medium-low.  Stir in the sour cream and blue cheese.  Stir until everything is well combined.  Add the cooked meatballs, cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes to combine flavors."
- "Add the cooked, drained egg noodles and gently stir everything together so the noodles get nicely coated with the sauce.  Add the green onion tops.  It&#39;s ready to serve!"
- "Enjoy!"
