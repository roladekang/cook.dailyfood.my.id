recipeingredient:
- " white potatoes"
- " cold water"
- " sugar"
- " Canola oil for frying"
- " corn syrup if you have"
recipeinstructions:
- "Peel and cut the potatoes into chip sized pieces."
- "Take the fries and put them into some cold water in a bowl or jug to get rid of the excess starch. Leave them in water for about 3-4 minutes."
- "Take another bowl/jug and fill it with boiling water. Add a third of a cup of sugar and a dollop of corn syrup if you have some and mix until they are dissolved in the water."
- "Take the fries and put them in the sugar water mix for 10 minutes."
- "Remove the fries and dry them off on a plate with paper towels. Make sure to get all the excess moisture off the fries."
- "Put the fries into the freezer on a plate for 20 minutes. While they are in the freezer, heat up the canola oil to about medium/medium high heat. You can test if it is hot enough by taking one fry and putting it into the oil. If the oil bubbles, it means it is hot enough."
- "Remove the fries from the freezer after 20 minutes and place them into the hot canola oil. Deep fry them for approximately 2 minutes. Remove them just before they start browning. This cooks the inside making it fluffy."
- "Once you have removed them, put them on a plate for about 10 minutes, letting them cool off slightly."
- "After the ten minutes of cooling, put them back in the oil for another 5-7 minutes. This makes the fries crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside."
- "Remove the fries after 5-7 minutes and put on a plate. Season them immediately and serve."
