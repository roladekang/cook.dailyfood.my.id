- "There is a large and small side of a scallop. Always sear the larger side 1st. Sear the scallops in batches. Do not crowd the skillet.*  Tilt the skillet and baste the scallops with the hot oil.  Keep basting until the bottom is browned."
- "Flip and add in the ghee mixture.  Tilt the skillet and continue basting with all the liquid.  Remove from heat and set aside on a plate lined with parchment paper to drain off any excess oil."
