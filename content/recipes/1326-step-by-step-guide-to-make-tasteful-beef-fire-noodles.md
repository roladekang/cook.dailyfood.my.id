recipeingredient:
- "1.5 nests of dried medium egg noodles"
- "120 g frozen beef mince I used 12 fat"
- "2 heaped tsp crunchy garlic chilli oil I used Sun Wah"
- "1 spring onion finely chopped greens and whites seperated"
- "1/2 small onion chopped very finely"
- "1.5 inch fresh ginger chopped very finely"
- "1 tbsp light soy sauce"
- "1 tsp dark soy sauce"
- "1 tiny pinch white pepper"
- "1 pinch salt"
- "1 small glug cooking oil I used vegetable"
- "1/4 tsp msg optional"
- " To garnish"
- "1 tsp sesame oil"
- "1 red birdseye chilli optional"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook the noodles according to packet instructions, once cooked drain off, rinse under cold water and set aside. Heat up a wok and add in a glug of cooking oil. Once hot add in the chopped ginger, onions plus the whites of the spring onion and fry over a medium high heat for around one and a half to two minutes until starting to soften and fragrant. Add in the beef mince and begin to fry. Move about the wok, seasoned with salt and pepper. Turn down the heat to medium."
- "As the beef begins to soften, break up and brown add in the msg (optional), then fry off for about 20 seconds. Add the light and dark soy sauce and toss everything together to incorporate. Next add in the garlic chilli oil. I found that 2 heaped tsp worked well for me, but add one first, taste then add the next if you feel it needs more heat, this is to personal preference."
- "Toss everything together then add in the cooked noodles. Give everything a good toss again so everything is evenly distributed. Here I added another level tsp of the chilli oil (red oil only), to give even further heat to the noodles. Serve up and garnish with the greens of the spring onion and drizzle over some sesame oil. Place a red chilli on top as a pretty garnish. Enjoy!"
