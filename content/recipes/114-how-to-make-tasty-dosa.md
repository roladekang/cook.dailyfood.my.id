Hello everybody, hope you're having an incredible day today. Today, I will show you a way to make a special dish, dosa. It is one of my favorites. This time, I am going to make it a bit unique. This will be really delicious.

A dosai or dosa or dose is a thin pancake or crepe, originating from South India, made from a fermented batter predominantly consisting of lentils and rice. It is somewhat similar to a crepe in appearance, although savoury flavours are generally emphasized (sweet variants also exist). Its main ingredients are rice and black gram, ground together in a fine, smooth batter with a dash of salt. Dosas are crispy, savory pancakes that are a staple food in South India.

History of dosa says that they were made using only rice but with the passage of time, people started to add urad dal / black lentils to give texture and taste. Dosa are savory crepes, found throughout South Asia, that date back more than a thousand years, if not much longer. Achaya in Indian Food: A Historical Companion, ancient dosa were very different from the crisp and paper-thin versions we know today. Instead, they were thick, dense pancakes.
