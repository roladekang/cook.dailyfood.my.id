- " Salmon MUST BE CAUGHT THE SAME DAY IT IS EATEN AS IT IS RAW"
- " Prawns"
- " Tinned tuna"
- " Curly parsley"
- " Cucumber"
- " Avocado"

recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the 2 cups of rice with 2 3/4 cups water. Cook for twenty minutes or until all is absorbed and transfer to a bowl to cool. Whilst it is still hot, add the vinegar, salt and mirin, and combine with a wooden paddle."
- "Cut up the avocado, pepper, salmon and cucumber. Butterfly the prawns and shred the tuna."
- "Once the rice is room temperature, choose which type of sushi to make first."
- "NIGIRI: Wet your hands and do not dry. The rice will stick otherwise. Make a small sausage with your thumbs using the rice, and then lay a piece of shrimp or salmon on top and shape again, pressing into your palm. Wrap a thin piece of nori around the Nigiri and it is ready to serve."
- "MAKI: Prepare the bamboo roller by covering it with a piece of cling film. Add a sheet of nori, making sure the shorter side is facing the shorter end of the roller. Lay a thin layer of rice on 3/4 of the nori, and then add the peppers, cucumber and salmon on the end with the rice. Roll the Maki carefully, making sure to tuck in the nori as you roll so it stays tight. Roll it up tight and put in the fridge for fifteen minutes. Repeat for the tuna maki, using tuna, pepper, cucumber and avocado."
- "Using a very sharp knife, slice the maki to make small but thick makis. Use any leftover fish to serve as sashimi."
- "Serve with soya sauce, wasabi and pickled ginger. I also had haddock on the side. Enjoy!"

![Sushi (Maki and Nigiri)](https://img-global.cpcdn.com/recipes/6e67f2f9539101a0/680x482cq70/sushi-maki-and-nigiri-recipe-main-photo.jpg)

Hello everybody, it is Jim, welcome to our recipe page. Today, we're going to make a special dish, sushi (maki and nigiri). One of my favorites. For mine, I'm gonna make it a bit tasty. This is gonna smell and look delicious.

Nigiri sushi - from &#34;nigiru&#34;, which means &#34;to grasp/grip&#34;, likely due to the method of forming the block of rice that serves as the base of a nigiri. Example: Maki sushi - from &#34;maku&#34;, which means &#34;to wrap/roll&#34; for the obvious reason of wrapping it in seaweed (which is called &#34;nori&#34;). Sushi made of meats other than fish (whether raw or cooked) is a variation often seen in Japan. Yaki anago-ippon-nigiri (焼きアナゴ一本握り) - a roasted Ebifurai-maki (エビフライ巻き) - fried-shrimp roll.

Sushi (Maki and Nigiri) is one of the most popular of current trending meals in the world. It is appreciated by millions daily. It's simple, it is quick, it tastes yummy. They're fine and they look wonderful. Sushi (Maki and Nigiri) is something that I have loved my entire life.

This giant Sushi challenge was made to destroy people! Featuring premium maki, nigiri and sashimi, this is a big sushi meal! These homemade nigiri and maki rolls are nutritious, low in calories and, even though we&#39;re all about whole grains, with sushi it&#39;s best to use sushi rice instead of brown rice. Raw fish has a very delicate flavor that is easily overpowered by brown rice and when it comes to texture, you want sushi to melt.

1. Prepare the 2 cups of rice with 2 3/4 cups water. Cook for twenty minutes or until all is absorbed and transfer to a bowl to cool. Whilst it is still hot, add the vinegar, salt and mirin, and combine with a wooden paddle.
1. Cut up the avocado, pepper, salmon and cucumber. Butterfly the prawns and shred the tuna.
1. Once the rice is room temperature, choose which type of sushi to make first.
1. NIGIRI: Wet your hands and do not dry. The rice will stick otherwise. Make a small sausage with your thumbs using the rice, and then lay a piece of shrimp or salmon on top and shape again, pressing into your palm. Wrap a thin piece of nori around the Nigiri and it is ready to serve.
1. MAKI: Prepare the bamboo roller by covering it with a piece of cling film. Add a sheet of nori, making sure the shorter side is facing the shorter end of the roller. Lay a thin layer of rice on 3/4 of the nori, and then add the peppers, cucumber and salmon on the end with the rice. Roll the Maki carefully, making sure to tuck in the nori as you roll so it stays tight. Roll it up tight and put in the fridge for fifteen minutes. Repeat for the tuna maki, using tuna, pepper, cucumber and avocado.
1. Using a very sharp knife, slice the maki to make small but thick makis. Use any leftover fish to serve as sashimi.
1. Serve with soya sauce, wasabi and pickled ginger. I also had haddock on the side. Enjoy!


These homemade nigiri and maki rolls are nutritious, low in calories and, even though we&#39;re all about whole grains, with sushi it&#39;s best to use sushi rice instead of brown rice. Raw fish has a very delicate flavor that is easily overpowered by brown rice and when it comes to texture, you want sushi to melt. Nigiri sushi isn&#39;t rolled like maki. Instead, a thin slice of raw or cooked fish is layered atop a mound of vinegary rice. Typically, a small amount of wasabi is placed between the fish and the rice, though in some case In Japanese, nigiri translates to &#34;two fingers,&#34; which refers to the size of the rice portion.
