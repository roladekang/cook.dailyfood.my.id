recipeingredient:
- "250 g Plain Flour"
- "1 teaspoon baking powder"
- "1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda"
- "1 teaspoon salt"
- "3 ripe bananas"
- "1 tablespoon milk"
- "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon"
- "110 g softened unsalted butter"
- "200 g golden caster sugar"
- "2 medium eggs"
- "200 g dark chocolate"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat oven to 170 degrees C / Gas mark 3. Grease a 2lb loaf tin."
- "Cream the sugar &amp; butter together until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating each one after adding. Roughly chop the bananas into the butter/sugar mix and add the milk &amp; cinnamon too. Using a wooden spoon mash the bananas roughly into the buttery mixture but don’t go too OTT. It’s ok to leave lumpy bits of banana – it all breaks down in the baking anyway and it’s nice to get a ‘hit’ of banana in some bites!"
- "Sift in the flour &amp; add the salt, baking powder &amp; bicarb of soda. Stir that through the mixture. Roughly chop up your block of chocolate into whatever size pieces you want and fold that into the mixture. Pour it into your loaf tin and roughly level it out. Pop it into the middle of the oven and let it bake for around 60-70 minutes – until a skewer poked in the middle comes out clean (allowing for any melted chocolate of course.)"
- "Cool in the tin for 10 minutes before turning it out onto a wire rack to cool completely before DEVOURING!"
