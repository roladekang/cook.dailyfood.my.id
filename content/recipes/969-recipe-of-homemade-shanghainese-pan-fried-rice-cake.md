recipeinstructions:

- "Can drain cabbage n cut shreds (throw ends)"

- "Wash pan or if lazy like me just wipe it with a cloth or paper towel"
- "Mid high heat add at least 2 spoonful of oil then place rice cake in. (please note they will stick together when pan frying so must keep on turn and toss them around) i prefer non stick pans or its gonna be a nightmare ðŸ˜– / or u need to add more oil to normal pans"
- "After 1 min add 1 spoonful of dark soya sauce. quickly stir them (some might look burnt but dont worry just make sure all covered in sauce)"
- "Add all pork and veg into the pan and stir for 2~3 mins. Ideal colour of the dish is a mid light brown colour just add little dark soya sauce if needed. Taste rice cake if it is soft then its Done!"
- "This dish i used bak choy last time. Traditional uses cabbage only. Besides these two type of veg i would not prefer others since gonna go weird. Enjoy!"
